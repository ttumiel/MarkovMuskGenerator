1.01550745381804E+018,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
1.01536646195763E+018,Good idea
1.01536397361143E+018,"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary & less susceptible to panic attack."

1.01536060419277E+018,"Yeah, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about in that tweet ‚Äî double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
1.01535944387636E+018,Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube & rock wall.
1.01535575847153E+018,It‚Äôs open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
1.01535021280875E+018,"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
1.01534227701778E+018,I would def recommend this
1.01534193711555E+018,Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks & front/rear rope tow hitch & lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
1.01533455500208E+018,Interesting
1.01531075283022E+018,"Great, thanks"
1.01530787682955E+018,Inflatable tubes & pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand & is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
1.01528616538399E+018,"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out & water won‚Äôt come in"
1.01527618529343E+018,"Does you know output voltage & amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
1.01513895369388E+018,SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
1.01513745690193E+018,"Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit."
1.01511656747701E+018,"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
1.01511548109778E+018,Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
1.01510845806712E+018,"Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you‚Äôre in an air tube, time doesn‚Äôt matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
1.01510550010541E+018,Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
1.01500448956726E+018,Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for & parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.

1.0001304458566E+018,I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
1.00009808085791E+018,"Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year & is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in 2015 when we were just figuring things out."

1.00008494470457E+018,Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. It‚Äôs called ‚Äúsatire‚Äù ‚Ä¶

9.99845637385404E+017,I‚Äôve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest & yet believe that same public is too stupid & immoral to assess their credibility. It‚Äôs amazing that you don‚Äôt understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
9.99841559846633E+017,The Tesla facility is open plan & we‚Äôre not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well & they are some of the worst & best human beings I‚Äôve ever met. You‚Äôre the former.

9.99797465787191E+017,"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world & products that haven‚Äôt been unveiled yet. You don‚Äôt have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
9.99796653560283E+017,"Wow, you‚Äôre ignorant. Don‚Äôt remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law & land you in jail. I didn‚Äôt review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
9.99619147305661E+017,Done

9.99568719146725E+017,"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
9.99560417637581E+017,Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don‚Äôt realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
9.99524442211418E+017,"Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."
9.99520453071856E+017,I did to any who asked

9.99424262925533E+017,Thank you! I thought it was so obvious ‚Ä¶
9.99415738967278E+017,Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
9.99398212162105E+017,"Yeah, I think you do great work"

9.9938207084877E+017,Of course
9.99378223661138E+017,"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla & millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we‚Äôre doing our best to make clean energy real & be a good company."

9.99375777882751E+017,Will do
9.99374720368689E+017,Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
9.99371548053E+017,That‚Äôs why editors are included too
9.99370318383743E+017,We don‚Äôt. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
9.99369623484039E+017,"Even if some of the public doesn‚Äôt care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors & publications will. It is how they define themselves."
9.99369022280843E+017,Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
9.99368671972622E+017,Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join

9.99365292684862E+017,"Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
9.99364333674025E+017,"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks & earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn‚Äôt advertise, but fossil fuel companies & gas/diesel car companies are among world‚Äôs biggest advertisers."
9.99363031996949E+017,The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
9.99361510915768E+017,Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he‚Äôs above criticism. Try being truthful & the public will believe you again.
9.99357298861486E+017,"Thought you‚Äôd say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just like Trump!‚Äù Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
9.99355619390865E+017,"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them https://twitter.com/electrekco/status/999318852365303808¬†‚Ä¶"

9.99056596935234E+017,Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
9.99056071489548E+017,Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
9.99020811930423E+017,Interesting he stops at ‚Äò09. That‚Äôs when you drove GM & Chrysler into bankruptcy & lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.

9.99010167793504E+017,"But ya know what, let‚Äôs test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago & left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them & wages were lower. Maybe. Let‚Äôs hold a vote & find out."
9.98996397570441E+017,"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM & Chrysler to bankruptcy & lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over & now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry & everyone knows it."
9.98988641702527E+017,"We‚Äôre going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X & 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
9.98988091556704E+017,Good point
9.98987396870951E+017,"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness & enforcement of 2 class ‚Äúlords & commoners‚Äù system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system!

9.98984720783323E+017,"More ‚ÄúReveal‚Äù bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, & they‚Äôve never found us to misrepresent.

9.98981687743742E+017,No problem
9.98980096181629E+017,"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
9.98953706673488E+017,"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
9.98950122225455E+017,I didn‚Äôt meet with him
9.9879762246171E+017,I definitely don‚Äôt do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can‚Äôt be creative otherwise.
9.98786412970369E+017,Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
9.98782142556467E+017,"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn‚Äôt fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
9.98780707164996E+017,"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
9.98779781230379E+017,"To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today‚Äôs Model S is far more refined than initial production."
9.98778751767871E+017,ABS calibration algorithm
9.98778081492926E+017,"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
9.98777288559755E+017,"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won‚Äôt stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
9.98765102248542E+017,"Stop, you‚Äôre making me blush ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
9.9876215675245E+017,"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little"
9.98761472292352E+017,Complexity is the devil. Words can‚Äôt express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp & trying to get to profitability. But we‚Äôll try.
9.98739940073591E+017,"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
9.98739763543736E+017,"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3‚Äôs have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we‚Äôve seen anything like this."
9.98738577344229E+017,"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3‚Äôs having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
9.98738003668357E+017,"Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out & address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
9.98673550616621E+017,"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers & beeping forklifts you said didn‚Äôt exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com."

9.98454539941368E+017,Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.
9.98449970528248E+017,"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines & tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as ‚Äúfacts‚Äù by Reveal."

9.98401234070581E+017,Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
9.9840011015655E+017,"With production, 1st you need achieve target rate & then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money & die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla & live."
9.98372753362174E+017,That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
9.98372206588539E+017,Exactly üöÄüí´üéâ! That will be really fun & shed light on what‚Äôs happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
9.98370453474312E+017,"Yeah, ‚ÄúReveal‚Äù was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today‚Äôs non-union."
9.98369524599505E+017,"About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried & hourly, union & non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally & on social media & lied about it."
9.98124236542656E+017,Yes
9.98124143685001E+017,Exactly
9.98124140090376E+017,They can form a union whenever they want & there‚Äôs nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don‚Äôt want to.

9.98090184288694E+017,Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
9.98089917065454E+017,"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."
9.98089603964748E+017,Good idea ...
9.98089449400517E+017,That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
9.98088849636016E+017,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front & a motor in rear. One is optimized for power & one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination & don‚Äôt get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
9.98087743530914E+017,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec & top speed to 140 mph.
9.98086435692425E+017,Black & white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
9.98085901069599E+017,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
9.9808565595877E+017,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker & with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."

9.96134672638755E+017,"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
9.9613389489313E+017,"It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released."
9.96132429772411E+017,What‚Äôs actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
9.96131586469843E+017,"It‚Äôs super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage  https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/tesla-with-autopilot-slams-into-truck-stopped-at-red-light/2018/05/12/18d2e740-563e-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.7466cb626644¬†‚Ä¶"
9.96121794246427E+017,Yes
9.96112995636859E+017,"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It‚Äôs not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
9.9610291981135E+017,"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."
9.95823298888991E+017,Happy Mother‚Äôs Day Mom! Love you so much.
9.95822814291673E+017,"Fair criticism, but we‚Äôre fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."

9.95462943079723E+017,"SpaceX will prob build 30 to 40 rocket cores for ~300 missions over 5 years. Then BFR takes over & Falcon retires. Goal of BFR is to enable anyone to move to moon, Mars & eventually outer planets."

9.95447960895865E+017,"Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines ‚Äî quaint, but not something you‚Äôd actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines & trains in general."
9.95446819369845E+017,"Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."

9.95028864672788E+017,"Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange ‚Ä¶"
9.9502109951871E+017,"I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
9.94980692160217E+017,Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD & performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.

9.92381848104747E+017,"True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them."
9.92378642830262E+017,"We went through the same drama on S & X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
9.92374493132743E+017,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising & no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
9.92372195304198E+017,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"

8.66797334037807E+017,Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.

8.45285846936826E+017,"The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?"
8.45285398662197E+017,How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?
8.4528500721195E+017,"Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!"
8.45284550926221E+017,I think so
8.45284390397665E+017,"No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S."
8.45283880080851E+017,Tues/Wed
8.45283534948393E+017,Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
8.45283253602828E+017,Tues/Wed next week
8.4528293454635E+017,"Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away."
8.45282733546922E+017,"Yes, but not until next year"
8.45282590030361E+017,Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
8.45282298291339E+017,"Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot"
8.45281640972661E+017,How about now?
8.4528154736835E+017,Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
8.45281211626865E+017,All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
8.45280846764397E+017,Definitely
8.45280754871419E+017,"Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)"
8.45279897383711E+017,Yes
8.45279423238591E+017,"Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range & power & fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."
8.45278449811939E+017,"Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true."
8.45277819282219E+017,Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
8.45215504738402E+017,"I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful."
8.45180973394248E+017,Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
8.45179612644618E+017,The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
8.45177494575636E+017,"Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle."
8.45175921317335E+017,I hope that didn't work

8.44970083000578E+017,Looks like Tues/Wed for 8.1 release
8.44668567983313E+017,Except that isn't actually my house ...
8.44360899603288E+017,"Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it."
8.44360665900839E+017,I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
8.42233727115702E+017,"3 is a great car, but definitely Model S"
8.41565055552389E+017,Good point
8.41564430399807E+017,I wish. It's so annoying.
8.41563925707547E+017,"Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ... https://twitter.com/theonion/status/841311395543113728¬†‚Ä¶"
8.41098180573852E+017,Ok
8.41041891747545E+017,"It's been a bear to get done, but prob 10 days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results"
8.41041532140446E+017,"Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ."
8.41041070792229E+017,"Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency."
8.41040566867509E+017,"Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches"
8.41039231694787E+017,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially @mcannonbrookes"
8.41011061935362E+017,I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
8.40780746868441E+017,"Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"
8.40774191049658E+017,High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-voltage_direct_current¬†‚Ä¶
8.40772319526113E+017,"Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power & electronics both DC."
8.40770270776316E+017,You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC. https://twitter.com/turnbullmalcolm/status/840763614856339456¬†‚Ä¶
8.40410357122314E+017,"Just spoke with @JayWeatherill, Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution."
8.40101692087583E+017,"Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control"
8.40096176678421E+017,$250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
8.40032197637685E+017,Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
8.38569247555015E+017,Will send you one

8.35361919775101E+017,of course
8.3535108194535E+017,maybe one of those too
8.35350234049864E+017,Roller coasters are awesome
8.35202594968478E+017,Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
8.3518785915802E+017,Good chance it will
8.35187686151315E+017,Exactly :)
8.35185478512992E+017,I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better

8.3332989616837E+017,no
8.32995083519615E+017,System was green for launch. I called it off.
8.32992529872097E+017,"They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018."
8.32986598627107E+017,"Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
8.32984361989386E+017,"Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
8.3297995509282E+017,"Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
8.32973218348626E+017,"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
8.32970849791537E+017,"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."
8.32871068066943E+017,Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo 11 launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast‚Ä¶  https://www.instagram.com/p/BQpXxl5BIYX/¬†

8.32788691588297E+017,Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
8.32647116816151E+017,"Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow. https://twitter.com/spacex/status/832644375863717889¬†‚Ä¶"
8.32619549937668E+017,"Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed"

8.32086234302341E+017,They are doing India proud
8.32085891715723E+017,You may come to regret that request :)
8.32085554619572E+017,"Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?"
8.32084918645596E+017,"Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!"
8.32084402473627E+017,"Apparently, there is this thing called ""Dad jokes"" and I make them"

8.31972894355829E+017,they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published. I said the same thing a week already.

8.28304178644656E+017,People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.

8.28298780638401E+017,"I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful."
8.28297954314289E+017,Really? I already have both feet in my mouth and am levitating on my own idiocy...
8.28297337353155E+017,True. Me being one of them :)
8.28297251026002E+017,"Not perfect & cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"

8.28289948767896E+017,Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.

8.28287354741936E+017,You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
8.28285894570422E+017,Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
8.28285409675342E+017,Mostly anti-drug laws
8.28284802327523E+017,Exactly
8.2828463117056E+017,"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
8.28284048103579E+017,The remedy for that is changing the law
8.28282768559849E+017,"Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
8.28282648711803E+017,There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
8.28281953455579E+017,True!
