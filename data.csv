0,"Both, but demo Starship is being built now, whereas Super Heavy hardware will start getting built in spring"
1,But cool pics of the demo Starship that will fly suborbital hops coming in ~4 weeks
2,Yes
3,Interesting
4,"Fairly heavy metal, but extremely strong"
5,The new design is metal
6,"As far as we know, it’s the largest single piece titanium casting in the world. Major improvement over the old aluminum grid fins, as the titanium doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint."
7,Boring Company product launch on Dec 18. More than a tunnel opening. Will include modded but fully road legal autonomous transport cars & ground to tunnel car elevators.
8,Tracking shot of Falcon water landing
9,"Engines stabilized rocket spin just in time, enabling an intact landing in water! Ships en route to rescue Falcon. "
10,"Pump is single string. Some landing systems are not redundant, as landing is considered ground safety critical, but not mission critical. Given this event, we will likely add a backup pump & lines."
11,We may use it for an internal SpaceX mission
12,"Yes, cutaway was a mistake. We will show all footage, good or bad."
13,"Grid fin hydraulic pump stalled, so Falcon landed just out to sea. Appears to be undamaged & is transmitting data. Recovery ship dispatched."
14,Falcon/Dragon launch to @Space_Station in 9 minutes  …
15,Us too sigh
16,"Falcon fairing halves missed the net, but touched down softly in the water. Mr Steven is picking them up. Plan is to dry them out & launch again. Nothing wrong with a little swim."
17,64 satellites 🛰 on this flight!  …
18,"We’re adding police car, fire truck & ambulance to the Tesla neural net in coming months"
19,"Exactly. Default Autopilot behavior, if there’s no driver input, is to slow gradually to a stop & turn on hazard lights. Tesla service then contacts the owner. Looking into what happened here."
20,It is so hard to move in armor!
21,You’re all hired!
22,Yes … no … maybe …
23,None shall pass!  …
24,Ok
25,Good advice
26,Applying a hydrophobic coating to the radar (located just below nose of car) should help. Easy to do yourself or Tesla service can do it. We’re also working on vision-only driving.
27,Glad you’re ok
28,"Perhaps most telling is that Norway, which is partly above the Arctic Circle, has more Teslas per capita than any other country on Earth."
29,"As the battery warms up, almost all of that is recovered. There is a roughly 10% range loss for cabin heating. Cabin heating impact on range is higher in slow traffic, but range is also higher in slow traffic."
30,"Incoming rocket & fairing probably visible, but landing itself is over the horizon"
31,You got it!
32,"Three things, one of which is CH4"
33,No
34,No
35,"Reentry scorchmarks, not simple soot. Can’t wipe it off."
36,Haha
37,"Prof Dahn is correct (he’s great), but the relative benefit is small. I’d recommend 10% more SoC for convenience."
38,"Not worth going below 80% imo. Even 90% is still fine. Also, no issue going to 5% or lower SoC."
39,True ♥️
40,♥️♥️♥️♥️🛸🛸🛸🛸♥️♥️♥️♥️
41,Both
42,Your Tesla can function as a boat for brief periods of time  …
43,One day
44,"We’re doing an EIR for the greater LA tunnel network. Thought we might need a N-S test tunnel (hence Sepulveda proposal), but we’re just going to do rock core samples along that corridor instead."
45,Update soon
46,Sorry ☺️
47,Boring breakthrough @BoringCompany
48,Definitely
49,"After safety, our goal is to make a Tesla the most fun you could possibly have in a car"
50,We tried. Nintendo won’t license it to us.
51,That would be cool
52,Haha kinda true 😀
53,Never heard of it
54,"Super fun software Easter eggs coming to all Tesla S/3/X cars before the holidays! Romance mode, toilet humor & more video games."
55,Software upgrade to rain sensing neural net coming next month
56,Yes
57,"This is completely backwards. Based on what we’ve learned from the Hawthorne test tunnel, we’re moving forward with a much larger tunnel network under LA. Won’t need a second test tunnel under Sepulveda."
58,"You can summon your Tesla from your phone. Only short distances today, but in a few years summon will work from across the continent.  …"
59,"Cool! Actually, if you buy a Tesla without a test drive, you have 3 days to return it. If you buy after a test drive, you still have 24 hours. Trying to incent buying with no test drive.  …"
60,Tiny wizard 🧙‍♂️
61,7 to 10 years
62,"Engineers, artists & creators of all kinds. There is so much to build."
63,Touché
64,"But if you love what you do, it (mostly) doesn’t feel like work"
65,"Varies per person, but about 80 sustained, peaking above 100 at times. Pain level increases exponentially above 80."
66,"There are way easier places to work, but nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week"
67,"Join to create exciting new worlds of technology!! If getting things done matters to you, then @SpaceX, @Tesla, @BoringCompany & @Neuralink are the places to be.  …"
68,Congratulations! What an amazing track record of success with Mars!
69,😉😉
70,1000 liters of pure water costs $1
71,"For those worried about running out of fresh water, it may help to know that desalination only costs 0.1 cents per liter or half a cent per gallon"
72,Ah yes fair point
73,"Used to live in Silicon Valley, now I live in Silicone Valley"
74,Not yet
75,🖤 trouble
76,Earth is
77,"Earth’s crust is only ~1% of Earth mass, so technically we should be called Lava "
78,"Earth should be called Water. Our surface is 71% water. Mars land area is roughly equal to Earth, as it’s all land. Even when warmed up & water ice turns liquid, Mars will be about 2/3 land."
79,"Yeah, good idea to offer that as a setting"
80,"Contour remains approx same, but fundamental materials change to airframe, tanks & heatshield"
81,"If you don’t want a Tesla, here’s a list of all electric cars in North America   … via @cleantechnica"
82,Signing off for a while
83,Happy Thanksgiving!!
84,🚀 Starships were meant to fly 🚀  …
85,Starship Tooters
86,Good one
87,Good idea
88,Coming soon
89,Shifting resources from sales to service for next several days
90,Should be next week
91,"No, it’s the first or boost stage, analogous to, but much larger than Falcon 9"
92,Later versions will
93,"Technically, two parts: Starship is the spaceship/upper stage & Super Heavy is the rocket booster needed to escape Earth’s deep gravity well (not needed for other planets or moons)"
94,Renaming BFR to Starship
95,"No, we’re just going to accelerate BFR"
96,Yes
97,"Supercharger V3, which starts rolling out early next year, will also charge much faster"
98,Tesla Supercharger capacity will double by end of next year. Expect to be within range of 95% to 100% of population in all active markets.
99,"No, it’s got enough load capacity & volume to carry the battery pack & our current pack energy density is about double that of original Roadster. Still, it would probably only save about 30% to 40% of effort, all things considered."
100,"In order of resource priority, but not necessarily production ramp, as that depends on thousands of parts & processes, which are extremely difficult to forecast"
101,"What really matters is time to volume production, not initial market intro. Apart from brief moments, Tesla vehicle production is limited by total battery output."
102,"Lot on our plate, so it’s either get van gliders (no battery, powertrain or compute tech) from Daimler & produce sooner or do all & produce later. Not a big difference to total vehicles produced either way. Priority list is Model Y, solar roof tiles, pickup, semi, Roadster."
103,Ok
104,Maybe interesting to work with Daimler/Mercedes on an electric Sprinter. That’s a great van. We will inquire.
105,Absolutely agree
106,Investigating
107,Probably mid 2019
108,Tesla can provide heating/cooling/lights/music for days using battery
109,"Not everywhere, but should be possible around major metros. Parts supply chain to UK should be fixed. Lmk if not."
110,Should be possible. Please ask service & lmk response.
111,"No, but perhaps in a few years"
112,"Yeah, good idea. We have that state internally, so can push data to phone app."
113,"Haha, just like Super Troopers"
114,Ideal situation in breakdown/accident (assuming no injuries) is that Tesla arrives at scene fast with top-of-the-line service loaner
115,Will allow having your car picked up & dropped off or using mobile Tesla Rangers service vans if car lift isn’t needed  …
116,Adding functionality to Tesla phone app allowing owners to request service for top issues with 1 or 2 taps  …
117,"Yes, no upgrades planned for F9. Minor tweaks to improve reliability only, provided NASA & USAF are supportive."
118,Radical change
119,"Btw, SpaceX is no longer planning to upgrade Falcon 9 second stage for reusability. Accelerating BFR instead. New design is very exciting! Delightfully counter-intuitive."
120,It will alert Tesla service automatically as fan power required to achieve target pressure drop exceeds spec level
121,"Set air flow to recirculating mode & manually raise blower speed to 5 in Model 3 for best air quality. Air filters are smaller than S/X, so clear air is achieved by circulating through filter several times.  …"
122,Congratulations @BoringCompany on completing the LA/Hawthorne tunnel! Cutting edge technology!
123,Boring Company just broke through the other side!!  …
124,Missed miku concert sigh
125,Listening to Better Now  …
126,"China, especially, is doing an amazing job moving towards sustainable energy generation & transport"
127,"Sure hope this isn’t true. It is the non-linearities, such as Siberian permafrost melting or ocean currents changing, that are most difficult to predict.  …"
128,Haha 😀
129,Looking back at the sun from upper stage & Falcon 9 🚀 landed on drone ship Of Course I Still Love You
130,$5 per min to argue with knight. $12 for 3 min bulk discount.
131,While (!castle) {brick++}
132,Watchtower (feat. knight) will be at LA/Hawthorne tunnel entrance
133,Fortnite irl
134,Boring Co is launching a whole product line of DIY watchtowers. You get bricks & a picture.
135,"Um, that is not our castle. I just found a picture on the Internet."
136,Not much but it is ours
137,The Boring Company is building a watchtower in LA out of dirt bricks & we need a knight to yell insults at people in a French accent  
138,"We have to truck to departure rail head & truck from arrival rail head, which is usually from customers. Car gets moved around rail yard a lot too & trains don’t leave often."
139,"Probably some deliveries in March, but April is more certain"
140,Yes
141,"Will also be using dedicated roll-on, roll-off fast ships for transporting cars to Europe & Asia in Q1. Major focus on minimizing time from factory to new owner. Did not fully appreciate the working capital impact until recently."
142,We bought some trucking companies & secured contracts with major haulers to avoid trucking shortage mistake of last quarter
143,Probably technically able to do so in about a year. Then up to regulators.
144,"Skipping rail saves over a month for East Coast deliveries. All things considered, it’s better to use trucks. Single load/unload & direct to owner location."
145,Tesla just acquired trucking capacity to ensure Model 3 can be delivered in US by Dec 31 if ordered by Nov 30  …
146,We will fight Big Tequila!
147,That would be awesome
148,Easily accessible energy
149,Send me a note!
150,Would be fun to add to Tesla
151,Yes
152,Will try again next month
153,"Congratulations @SpaceX team! Thanks @NASA, much appreciated.  …"
154,"Rest in peace, Stan Lee. The many worlds of imagination & delight you created for humanity will last forever."
155,Is he ok?
156,"It naturally follows that a hotter system will have more energetic events. For example, as a pot of water becomes colder, it becomes inert ice, but heating a pot of water turns it into a steam boiler.  …"
157,Scary sign of times to come. It will get worse.
158,"Agreed, technically, mined hydrocarbons come primarily from ancient, decayed marine organisms & partially from geological processes (CH4 particularly)"
159,"Makes me so mad when smart, ethical scientists I know are accused of publishing climate papers for “grant money”. They earn 🥜 vs their other opportunities, but give that up to help world. But their accusers make billions by slowing down clean energy. Which is more credible?"
160,"That is true & should be applauded. Right move is for oil companies truly to think of themselves as energy companies, but move rapidly towards clean, sustainable energy. Means lower profits short-term, but will make them stronger long-term."
161,"We know we’ll run out of dead dinosaurs to mine for fuel & have to use sustainable energy eventually, so why not go renewable now & avoid increasing risk of climate catastrophe? Betting that science is wrong & oil companies are right is the dumbest experiment in history by far …  …"
162,Because people on the ground know more about what’s actually needed than politicians do
163,"Good, but not hospital grade. S & X were designed to be proof against an actual bioweapon attack. Requires a giant filter with separate acid & alkaline gas neutralization layers. Not enough room in Model 3."
164,"If Tesla can help people in California wildfire, please let us know. Model S & X have hospital grade HEPA filters. Maybe helpful for transporting people."
165,"Fair point, will reenable"
166,"Agreed, top priority for Autopilot team. Being cautious for max safety."
167,Please lmk what you’d most like improved/fixed about your Tesla. Thanks!
168,Cool
169,"With similar track wheels/tires/brakes, Model S P100D is faster"
170,Yes
171,Would like to thank Robyn for joining the team. Great respect. Very much look forward to working together.
172,"No, we’re building a BFR dev ship to do supersonic through landing tests in Boca Chica, Texas"
173,Won’t land propulsively for those reasons. Ultra light heat shield & high Mach control surfaces are what we can’t test well without orbital entry. I think we have a handle on propulsive landings.
174,Aiming for orbital flight by June
175,Mod to SpaceX tech tree build: Falcon 9 second stage will be upgraded to be like a mini-BFR Ship
176,But comments are 👌
177,LA/Hawthorne demonstration tunnel activates Dec 10. Runs parallel to 105 freeway from Crenshaw Blvd to 405.
178,"I think Twitter is deleting fake, scam or maybe even inactive accounts. My follower count decreased by ~20k over the past few days."
179,"Sure, we can do it"
180,Zeroth Law
181,Foundation of psychohistory
182,I am not
183,True
184,2B or !2B
185,Love Oumuamua jokes
186,Remember the future
187,Oh hi guys … lol    …
188,"Yes, Germany has outstanding engineering talent"
189,"Just a few mins, which is mostly accelerating & decelerating"
190,So underappreciated
191,Ok
192,Ok
193,Walked full length of Boring Co tunnel under LA tonight. Disturbingly long. On track for opening party Dec 10. Will be very one-dimensional.
194,"Sounds like pure luxury! When I said ‘sponge’, I was actually speaking metaphorically. Truth is, I was just a simple nucleotide, drifting alone in small crevice with 3 trillion siblings."
195,What is love?
196,Bikini Bottom
197,Fair
198,"Yes, that is how"
199,We didn’t even have kids back then. Just little sponges.
200,Sea sponge. Humans would later use our bodies to clean dishes. So humiliating.
201,Wow that’s cool!
202,Kids these days have it easy
203,I remember when I was a sponge. Simpler times they were.
204,Haha
205,First movie I ever saw in theaters
206,When the only existing life was a sponge
207,Although it was in the precambrian era
208,Star Wars only had an $11M budget. Must have been in the galaxy of ridiculously low budgets.
209,They’re great! Honored to work with them.
210,Yes
211,Definitely
212,"Aspirationally, they will be made to the exact same specification, but we can vary cell quantity to account for empirical variation"
213,"Hopefully, partial presence in India, Africa & South America end of next year, with broader expansion in 2020"
214,"Recently asked service team to expand locations to all population regions (not just major metros) in North America, Eastern Europe, China & Japan by end of next year. We are completely missing vast geographic regions in some cases."
215,"To clarify further, the long-term goal for Tesla mass market products is local production for local markets (at least at the continent level). This is critical to make pricing as affordable as possible."
216,"Tesla will manufacture all battery modules & packs at China Giga, as we do today in California & Nevada. Cell production will be sourced locally, most likely from several companies (incl Pana), in order to meet demand in a timely manner."
217,"Amazing results by @Panasonic at Tesla Gigafactory Nevada! Very much appreciate extreme hard work it took to achieve this result. Together with Pana Japan cell plants, Tesla/Pana partnership is producing ~60% of global EV battery output!"
218,Prob 2 to 3 weeks
219,v true
220,cute
221,Haha
222,Bring Me the Horizon
223,Aiming for next week
224,♥️ Norway 🇳🇴
225,"#’s r wrong, but 🐻 in 🧠 Tesla makes 🚘s 4 overseas & East Coast in 1st half of quarter"
226,"Long-term, the car will work purely on vision, with radar just a plus, but maybe worth adding a radar heater anyway"
227,We can make it work from very far away. LoS is just for safety.
228,Hahaha <ahem>
229,Um yes
230,"Maybe AI will make me follow it, laugh like a demon & say who’s the pet now …"
231,"Also, you’ll be able to drive it from your phone remotely like a big RC car if in line of sight"
232,Car will drive to your phone location & follow you like a pet if you hold down summon button on Tesla app
233,"Tesla advanced Summon ready in ~6 weeks! Just an over-the-air software upgrade, so will work on all cars made in past 2 years (Autopilot hardware V2+)."
234,Scientists uncover Sneaky move by GM  …
235,"For those unfamiliar, this uses Tesla Autopark/Summon. Slightly smarter version hopefully ready soon. By next year, a Tesla should be able to drive around a parking lot, find an empty spot, read signs to confirm it’s valid & park."
236,Cool haha
237,"Legally required officers of a corporation are president, treasurer & secretary. Guess I have to keep 1st one or it will confuse the authorities."
238,"Good point, might put that one back"
239,Deleted my Tesla titles last week to see what would happen. I’m now the Nothing of Tesla. Seems fine so far.
240,Signing off Twitter for a few days ...
241,"Don’t worry, we’ll make it right"
242,The FOIA on this will be solid gold. Can’t wait.
243,Not going up. We will just offer those who ordered bought 3P either $5k back or free lifetime Supercharging.
244,"It’s a reasonable criticism. We wanted to make the awesome version of Model 3 Performance more affordable, but it was arguably too much too soon. Taking corrective action …"
245,"Exactly, this is total bs. What part of “production hell” sounds like a sure thing!?"
246,We will enable track mode for all performance cars
247,"It was underpriced. Anyway, if you want $5k refund & free Supercharging turned off, we will do that."
248,"Ok, we will turn off lifetime free Supercharging and give you $5k refund"
249,"Yeah, or free lifetime Supercharging, whichever you prefer"
250,Didn’t you get free Supercharging for life? Current buyers don’t get that.
251,Exactly. That’s Monday.
252,"Yes. Will require tapping indicator to confirm at first. When safety looks good after 10M miles of driving or so, there will be an option to turn off confirm."
253,"No, but I will"
254,Isn’t it obvious?
255,Worth it
256,True
257,Tesla Autopilot Drive on Navigation going to wide release in North America tonight
258,"Not exactly. We just bundled the upgrade package into Performance. No problem if you want to return the car, but I think lifetime free Supercharging is a good deal."
259,Haha
260,"On Insta, 10% of followers like even lame posts. On Twitter, good posts get 1%."
261,Lacks scale
262,"Reddit is massive, but def has gems"
263,"Reddit’s twitter account is lame, because it’s not real Reddit"
264,Exactly
265,You’re right. Earlier Model 3 Performance buyers got free lifetime Supercharging. Will add that to anyone who bought recently.
266,"On Twitter, likes are rare & criticism is brutal. So hardcore. It’s great."
267,Glad you’re ok @tylerthecreator  …
268,"S is better, but rear seat folds down in Model 3, so bikes can fit in trunk"
269,Hey that’s my Halloween costume!
270,Good question
271,"Clearly, you’re not reading my twitter"
272,I wish
273,Taking action. Tesla body shops now operating in California aiming for same day body repair in most cases.
274,Yes Zorbix
275,"Sir, I would never …"
276,"Yes, I am a little girl. Ok, not that little. Or a girl."
277,Making progress …
278,I said dankest not darkest omg
279,im actually cat girl here’s selfie rn
280,It’s pretty hot
281,"Deep down, I think Frost secretly preferred the latter"
282,Ok
283,Fire and Ice
284,"Flies like an arrow, but fruit flies like a banana"
285,Love the Concorde
286,Bound to happen
287,Yes
288,Time
289,Love Tesla supporters so much!!♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️ ♥️ ♥️♥️♥️ ♥️ ♥️♥️ ♥️ ♥️ ♥️ ♥️
290,Midnight
291,My twitter feed rn
292,Then the hell with science!
293,Not moths tho
294,Send me ur dankest memes!!
295,🐻 in 🧠
296,Fresh puro from my meme dealer
297,Exactly. There are many states where we are not allowed to sell cars at all or are severely restricted to literally one store.
298,"Model 3 was top-selling car in US by revenue despite no advertising, no paid endorsements & no discounts. Competitors spent billions on marketing. Model 3 was product alone."
299,Massive thanks to Tesla owners & supporters. We wouldn’t be here without you.
300,Same
301,2025
302,How’d they know!?
303,Around mid 2019
304,"There have been hundreds of improvements to fit & finish over the years, but no major step change in this regard. Seats, especially, are dramatically better now than in the past."
305,Only thing almost anyone would notice is the nose
306,Just did that to correct the front design esthetic of Model S. The nose of an electric car shouldn’t look like a radiator grill opening.
307,"Get this question a lot, so need to clarify that there’s no such thing as a Tesla “refresh”. Other car companies do this every ~3 years, but Tesla constantly upgrades vehicle hardware every week."
308,"To simplify production, many Tesla Model S & X interior configs, will no longer be available after Nov 1. Order now to be sure of the one you want."
309,"Model 3 body design could def be less complex, but, yes, most of weight difference is due to higher safety vs other cars"
310,Working on it
311,That is correct
312,Twitter thought I got hacked & locked my account haha
313,Wanna buy some Bitcoin? 😉😉
314,And I own a chibi Wolverine
315,i🖤anime
316,"Order Tesla without test drive & you get 3 days to return for refund, else 1 day  …"
317,Former
318,Will be in next point release
319,"Hopefully, a few months for Drive on Navigation capability. We need to address differences in how lane lines are painted. Varies greatly by country."
320,Good point …
321,Interesting
322,"This is a ~ 6000 ft demo tunnel. First operational, high-speed tunnel still set for Chicago, pending regulatory approvals."
323,Under LA (Hawthorne)
324,155 mph | 250 km/h
325,Opening event that night & free rides for the public next day
326,"Pretty close, actually"
327,I think real
328,Opens Dec 10
329,The first tunnel is almost done
330,N00B!
331,Twitter is Dark Souls of social media. Reddit is Bloodborne. Insta is Zelda.
332,Good idea!
333,"This game is my personal favorite, but I am biased towards space stuff"
334,Coming soon
335,Turn on enhanced security via the settings page. This will require entering a passcode to use the car.
336,♥️
337,Digital Style!  …
338,Would I really let someone get away with using my name all this time?
339,BoredElonMusk is my secret troll account. It’s time people knew.
340,"No, bored me, I will not"
341,Maybe phone as controller
342,Exactly
343,Coming
344,Yes
345,Reality is hard
346,Online doesn’t count
347,Coming soon
348,No
349,That’s next
350,Had to been done ur welcome
351,I hope this is true!
352,"If you don’t like a Tesla for any reason or no reason, you can just give it back for a full refund"
353,Also available off menu for a week. Was causing too much confusion.
354,"Model 3 long range, rear wheel drive is still available for ordering off menu for another week or so"
355,"It’s kind of like the post office. Same price for delivery to Maine as the SF Bay Area. But you do get a free Tesla factory tour, which is really fun to see."
356,"Tesla rear wheel drive cars do actually work well on snow & ice. We did our traction testing on an ice lake! Dual motor AWD is great, but not required for cold weather. Just don’t use sport/summer tires."
357,"It’s a long range battery with fewer cells. Non-cell portion of the pack is disproportionately high, but we can get it done now instead of ~February"
358,"Just released lower cost, mid-range Tesla Model 3 & super simple new order page  "
359,Week or two
360,Love the Reddit comments too
361,Dog saves her puppies  …
362,y
363,You’ll see
364,Tomorrow brings a lemur
365,Special Circumstances
366,Yes 😀
367,New Summon will use the Autopilot cameras
368,"Yes, aiming for next few months"
369,"True, but this will improve dramatically over next several months & all Tesla cars ever produced (except early Roadsters) will get improvements for free. Continuous, free over-the-air software updates is a big part of why a Tesla retains so much value over time."
370,Same goes for all countries within which we officially operate by end of next year
371,Just reviewed Tesla’s service locations in North America & realized we have major gaps in geographic coverage! Sorry for this foolish oversight. Tesla will aim to cover all regions of NA (not just big cities) within 3 to 6 months.
372,Insightful article by David @Pogue  …
373,"Thanks John, really admire you too! I think you’re one of the best engineers ever. Hope you return to working on rockets one day."
374,The FSD upgrade is the Tesla computer with our NN chip
375,I believe it’s $5k
376,~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving.
377,Somewhere between 500% & 2000%
378,"To be clear, actual NN improvement is significantly overestimated in this article. V9.0 vs V8.1 is more like a ~400% increase in useful ops/sec due to enabling integrated GPU & better use of discrete GPU."
379,"This is without the Tesla NN computer. Per my public comments, that will give the car an extra order of magnitude."
380,Still a long way to go
381,Model 3 motor & gearbox still in good condition after driving 1M miles. Designed for ultra high endurance.  …
382,Works best if you play games full screen & use steering wheel scroller balls for control  …
383,Haha. It is actually my fav game on Tesla cars right now 😀
384,🖤🖤🖤🖤 🚘🚘🚘🚘 🖤🖤🖤🖤  …
385,What are some of the most fun games we could have on a Tesla? Classic Atari is just the start.
386,Yes
387,"Thanks for recognizing the great work of the Tesla team! 45,000 people now."
388,It is time to create a mecha
389,NERV
390,<ahem> Elon-chan
391,Great. Also love Princess Mononoke.
392,Love Your Name  …
393,Maybe this could be part of a (safe) car version of Pokémon Go style game
394,Towelie 💗
395,Good idea!
396,Whole beer keg fits in Model 3 trunk!
397,"Wow, mechanical logic gates"
398,Comes with free towels. Nothing more useful in the entire Universe.
399,Maybe wise to bring it just in case 👽👾 😉
400,About half my money is intended to help problems on Earth & half to help establish a self-sustaining city on Mars to ensure continuation of life (of all species) in case Earth gets hit by a meteor like the dinosaurs or WW3 happens & we destroy ourselves
401,You should ask why I would want money. The reason is not what you think. Very little time for recreation. Don’t have vacation homes or yachts or anything like that.
402,Yes
403,"Tesla exists to help reduce risk of catastrophic climate change, which affects all species on Earth. Even if your faith in humanity is faltering, this is worth caring about. Support makes a difference. Thank you."
404,Visual approximation
405,Teslaquila coming soon …  …
406,Glad you’re safe
407,Beautiful picture
408,"Yes, it’s hard to find. Not sure why."
409,"Exactly. A Tesla is objectively much safer in a crash than all other cars, according to NHTSA’s *own* calculations. This is just physics!"
410,This is incorrect
411,At Falcon LZ-1 Vandenberg on Sunday night with the Base Commander. Support of @USAirForce much appreciated.
412,Studebaker Museum in South Bend
413,Punctuality is not my strong suit
414,We’d be nothing without our fans
415,Because 11 is obviously louder than 10 😀
416,No such thing as a “full refresh” at Tesla or even a model year. Our cars are partially upgraded every month as soon as a new subsystem is ready for production. There is no cadence.
417,It sure does. Very reliable.
418,You are right
419,A reminder of why it’s important to accelerate advent of cars powered by electricity made from solar power  …
420,"You’re most welcome, glad I could be helpful! Thanks for letting me know about it."
421,Warms my ❤️ 😀
422,"The physics of how Tesla achieved best safety of any cars ever tested. Note, when vehicle weight is taken into account, order is more like X,S, then 3, but they are all very close.  …"

424,Falcon has landed
425,"Tesla owner shows how well ultrawhite seats hold up after 25,000 miles. The black & white interior is def best imo.  "
426,What city & what Model 3 config?
427,My fav character
428,Sonic boom warning. This won’t be subtle.  …
429,Two — one for 👽 👾 millions of years from now and one for you
430,Yes
431,"Yes, but 🐻 in 🧠 that we’re creating a generalized autonomy solution. Must work in millions of strange 🚘 situations."
432,Blade Runner — Esper Edition — Vangelis  …
433,"Actually, it’s 1 of 3 forward cameras in rear view mirror assembly. External cameras will auto-activate in future if car is damaged while parked."
434,Fair point 😀
435,"When something sounds too good to be true, it usually is. Way the trick works is companies like Blackrock keep up to 50% of short interest revenue, but suffer almost none of equity decline, as they’re just “passive” managers. Blackrock made $597M in short lending last year!"
436,"Not all. However, shorting applied to market as a whole is obv net negative — it incents negative gdp! Moreover, it stops private companies from going public, preventing access by retirement funds & small investors, thus increasing wealth divide.  …"
437,V9 moving to wide release now. Holding back Autopilot drive on navigation for a few more weeks of validation. Extremely difficult to achieve a general solution for self-driving that works well everywhere.
438,Only if they’re extremely tiny
439,We don’t judge. Any pic you want!
440,Tesla owners can refer someone to buy a Tesla & get any image they want laser etched in glass & sent to deep space for millions of years  …
441,Rococo Basilisk is
442,First Falcon 9 land landing mission from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California coming up soon!  …
443,The CIO of a major pension fund is the one who deserves credit for uncovering this scam
444,"The big funds can & will, as they’re suffering a net loss. Index managers like Blackrock pocket make excessive profit from short lending while pretending to charge low rates for “passive” index tracking."
445,"Debatably true, if applied to individual stocks selectively & consciously, but obv false if applied broadly to most of the market & without clear consent of the shareholder"
446,"Where this breaks down is in passive index funds, which constitute most of the market. The holders of those funds, mostly small investors & retirement funds, don’t realize that their stocks are being lent to short sellers, diminishing their true equity return."
447,"There is no rational basis for a long holder to lend their stock to shorts, as it dilutes the shareholder base & gives the short a strong incentive to attack the company by whatever means possible, including regulators"
448,I hope to be less wrong over time
449,You’re most welcome. Hope to do more to help in the future.
450,What they do should be illegal
451,The last several years have taught me that they are indeed reasonably maligned
452,Exactly. Short-sellers are value destroyers. Should definitely be illegal.
453,"By revenue, taking publicly available selling prices, Model 3 actually outsold Camry by a factor of two  …"
454,This is amazing  …
455,Almost ready. We expanded the early access program to 1000 more users a few days ago.
456,"People sometimes forget that a company is just a group of people gathered together to make products. So long as it makes great products, it will have great value."
457,"If you think Tesla is overvalued compared to probable value of future cash flows, sell. Otherwise, buy."
458,"Hang in there. If you are truly long-term, it will be fine."
459,True
460,Sorry about the typo. That was unforgivable. Why would they be upset about their mission? It’s what they do.
461,Just want to that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!
462,Great verdict 😀  …
463,Could be worse 😇
464,"Tesla Autopilot team is awesome! Got to make sure we iron out the details though. Long tail of tricky edge cases. Important to get front wide angle, B pillar & side repeater camera neural nets just right."
465,Something especially weird going on with Yahoo news feed on iPhone stocks app. Almost always super negative. Maybe getting gamed.
466,Naughty by Nature 😉  …
467,Will do. Definitely moving heavily towards direct to work/home delivery of cars!
468,Tesla will deliver your car to you. This is the future. The way it should work.
469,That was intense  …
470,i❤️🇨🇦
471,!! Will take action.
472,And remember …
473,Huge thank you to all Tesla supporters for helping with car deliveries all around the world. You rock!!
474,Sorry for difficulties delivering your Tesla due to high volume! Critical to show that environmentally sustainable is financially sustainable.
475,Pace of innovation is all that matters in the long run
476,You’re welcome. Sorry for the delay!
477,What would be great is original Elite
478,Going over final tweaks tonight. Hopefully in wide release end of week.
479,♥️ Tesla Owners ♥️  …
480,"Increased tire pressure improves range. Also, if you have performance tires, they are stickier. Better handling, but slightly lower range."
481,😀
482,"Apologies, we’re upgrading our logistics system, but running into an extreme shortage of car carrier trailers. Started building our own car carriers this weekend to alleviate load."
483,Tricky one
484,"Wow, thanks for offering to help! The coming week is incredibly intense. If any current Tesla owners who’d like to help educate new owners could head to Tesla delivery centers during midday on Sat/Sun & morning/evening on weekdays, that would be super appreciated!"
485,Probably 2028 for a base to be built
486,Mars Base Alpha
487,"Consider an ice skater. Same weight, but spins/turns much faster with arms in vs arms out. Same principle is true for a car."
488,"Front vs rear wheel weight distribution, though commonly asked, isn't the right question. You can have 50% on front, 50% on rear & still have poor handling if mass elements are far from center. Dumbbell mass distribution is bad, spinning top/dreidel is good."
489,Simple explanation of polar moment of inertia & other important car terms at   …
490,"Key technical point is that the polar moment of inertia (concentration of mass around center) of a Tesla, to the extent of our knowledge, is better than any other production car. This positively affects safety, handling & driving feel. Extremely important metric."
491,A car propelled by combustion is far more likely to combust than an electric car
492,"Yes, when it comes to physics, make sure Newton is on your side"
493,"Helps improve forward crumple zone length, especially important in high speed frontal impacts, and moments of inertia in side impacts"
494,Tesla piece on the physics of car safety coming soon for those interested in technical details
495,"Exactly, all 5 star are *not* the same, as the videos show. “5 star” just means a car met a certain threshold, but injury probability stats (real numbers) tell you by how much."
496,Haha true
497,.@NHTSAgov will post final safety probability stats soon. Model 3 has a shot at being safest car ever tested.
498,👽💘
499,"Wow, glad they’re ok!"
500,Physics can be thought of as the compression algorithms of reality
501,♥️ @neiltyson
502,Tesla Rangers!
503,"31 engines, but with room to add 11 more down the road. Kinda have to."
504,"Yes, if there is no listener, a simulation probably wouldn’t spend computing power on sound"
505,Yes
506,True 😀  …
507,"To conserve computing power, a simulation would only render an object when it is observed"
508,You’re most welcome! Sorry for the delay.
509,Will do. Love Reddit.
510,Space Bar
511,"Long-term, there will be thousands and eventually, hopefully, millions of missions & anyone will be able to go"
512,"Yeah, Starlink should be active by then"
513,Sorry! So many bots!!
514,"Moon mission will be livestreamed in high def VR, so it’ll feel like you’re there in real-time minus a few seconds for speed of light"
515,Perhaps one of the invited artists choosing to play. There will be no obligation to do so.
516,Very close
517,😀
518,Always
519,Yes
520,That’s the first BFR airframe/tank barrel section made of a new carbon fiber material
521,"Yeah … that’s exactly how I feel. However it happens, I just hope it does."
522,Thanks for helping fund a rocket & spaceship that could take humanity beyond Earth!
523,Hanging out with @yousuck2020 before the @SpaceX moon mission announcement
524,Yusaku will be bringing 8 (brave) artists & cultural figures with him on the journey around the moon!  …
525,Probably V10 alpha build
526,"Yes, albeit a beta version. Will improve with V9.1."
527,Good news on this front. Tesla engineering rallied & this will be part of V9. Going through final testing now.
528,Thank you for your trust in the @SpaceX team. Greatly appreciated.  …
529,Will be interesting to see how this evolves over time
530,Will see what we can do. Really need to bring this program to an end while being as fair as possible. It’s not sustainable long-term.
531,Very interesting
532,"Due to some Tesla owners encountering system issues yesterday, the free Supercharging referral program will be extended until tomorrow night  …"
533,This is definitely worth thoughtful debate. What might we do differently to improve human/life happiness?
534,"Yes, I do"
535,Top SpaceX priority is and will remain supporting @NASA crewed spaceflight and National Security missions
536,"Btw, can’t emphasize enough how @SpaceX would not be where it is today without @NASA. Thank you."
537,With lasers
538,My fav tweet ever

547,Awesome 😎
548,"Design has been changed so the 🚀 lands on legs that extend from the tips of the three fins, two of which actuate (mostly for pitch control)"
549,"Sorry, it’s not really sustainable at volume production & doesn’t incent optimal behavior. We probably should have ended this earlier."
550,Yes
551,"Yeah, that’s our problem. Service & parts supply in general will be the top Tesla priority after we get through the insane car delivery logistics of the next few weeks."
552,"Outside repair shops are jack of all trades, which means supporting 1000’s of makes & models. Tesla collision repair specializes in three. Having all parts in stock & not waiting for insurance approval also make a world of difference."
553,Goal is for repaired car to be better than before accident. Should always be true if damaged/used parts are correctly replaced with newer parts.
554,"Exciting to see some Tesla collision repair operations already completing within 24 hrs. Aiming for same day soon, then under an hour."
555,"Tesla is bringing most collision repairs in-house, as outside firms take weeks to months for repairs, driving Tesla owners (and us) crazy"
556,True
557,"Tesla owners can grant free Supercharging for life to a friend who buys S/3/X. Ends tomorrow night.   …"""

573,"Due to a large increase in vehicle delivery volume in North America, Tesla customers may experience longer response times. Resolving this is our top priority."
574,"My apologies, am working on this exact issue right now"
575,Best show in the multiverse!
576,"No, service will stock all colors"
577,"Love that red. We tried every possible way to make red look 3D without floating a special red tint in primary gloss layer, but no way. We have to stop whole paint shop for red & it looks like an episode of Dexter."
578,"Moving 2 of 7 Tesla colors off menu on Wednesday to simplify manufacturing. Obsidian Black & Metallic Silver will still be available as special request, but at higher price."

592,"Am running it in my car, but it’s not right yet. Hopefully, will release to advanced early access users in a week or two, then more broadly towards end of month."
593,"Much appreciated! Great word-of-mouth is why Model 3 is the best-selling electric car, despite no advertising or paid endorsements."
594,"The multi-coat colors (pearl white & red) are hardest, red especially, as it has red tint in the clear coat layer itself for depth & complexity"
595,"Sorry, we’ve put pretty extreme rules in place for paint & quality in general. If need be, we’re repainting/replacing entire sections of car or building whole new cars. Got to be done."
596,Can Steve Bannon please insult me some more? Best PR I’ve had in a while.
597,!
598,I was told that his parents preferred that his name not be mentioned
599,V cool
600,So you actually did nothing & yet imply you are a truth-seeker. The Twitter name you chose is @yoda.
601,"Answer the question @yoda. You brought it up, not me. Did you investigate or not? If so, what did you actually do?"
602,"At this point, I want ETH even if it is a scam"
603,Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no. Why?
604,"It’s coming, I swear"
605,You don’t think it’s strange he hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services. And you call yourself @yoda …
606,Great actions by Twitter to delete bogus accounts. Will increase usage by real users.
607,"For the record, my voice cracked once during the NY Times article. That’s it. There were no tears."
608,Sure :)

610,"The world lost a great man in John McCain. He was an honorable, kind, brave and fundamentally decent human being. If only there were more such people in the world."
611,This is why a small company with tight focus & high energy can beat a big company without
612,This is utterly false. Fossil fuel merchants of doubt have been pushing that bs for years. Tesla Gigafactory will be 100% renewable powered (by Tesla Solar) by end of next year.
613,"Most people don’t realize that the cost of operating an electric vehicle is much lower than a gas car. Electricity is way cheaper than gas plus no oil changes, tune-ups,smog checks & other service costs."
614,"Most major customers have tried it & love it. Now we need to finish production design & build it, while avoiding dumb mistakes made with Model 3 production system. Wish it wasn’t so hard to be less stupid over time …"
615,Maybe …
616,"This was key showstopper for me personally. Couldn’t make it happen, even through expert fiduciary SPV, without creating exotic trust structure that would prob not be accepted by regulators. Current rules have good intentions, but make wealth creation harder for small investors."
617,"The extension cord was 1000 miles long, but still"
618,"What’s cool is that it was driven across the country alone (no escort or any accompanying vehicles), using the existing Tesla Supercharger network and an extension cord"
619,"In talking to our public investors, most were supportive of optimizing for long-term value creation over quarterly earnings. This was also a factor in remaining public."
620,It’s almost done
621,"Yes 😀🖤🚀, looks brutal otherwise"
622,This is actually real  …

627,Ok
628,"Love born in the brain is more spirited, doubtless, than true love, but it has only flashes of enthusiasm; it knows itself too well, it criticizes itself incessantly; so far from banishing thought, it is itself reared only upon a structure of thought. 🖤The Red and The Black♥️"

657,Model 3 traction testing on pure ice & snow  …
658,Great Q&A @defcon last night. Thanks for helping make Tesla & SpaceX more secure! Planning to open-source Tesla vehicle security software for free use by other car makers. Extremely important to a safe self-driving future for all.
659,"Thanks, great feedback. Will be a fun  project for Tesla design. Love the idea of adding a special item every few months, so whenever you go into a Tesla store, there is something new & delightful to see."
660,"Production design will be better, especially in details. We are dying to do this, but primary focus must remain on making affordable version of Model 3 & bringing Y to market"

675,Those are the new design made of titanium. Doesn’t need heat shielding or even paint.
676,"Sorry, meant to say same timeframe as hardware"
677,Yes
678,Probably 4 to 6 months. Those who order full self-driving get the upgrade at no cost. It isn’t needed just for enhanced Autopilot.
679,Tesla deliveries & AP hardware chart by @lexfridman at MIT
680,Investor support is confirmed. Only reason why this is not certain is that it’s contingent on a shareholder vote.  …
681,Def no forced sales. Hope all shareholders remain. Will be way smoother & less disruptive as a private company. Ends negative propaganda from shorts.
682,"Yes, but liquidity events would be limited to every 6 months or so (like SpaceX)"
683,No change
684,Shareholders could either to sell at 420 or hold shares & go private
685,Absolutely. Am super appreciative of Tesla shareholders. Will ensure their prosperity in any scenario.
686,My hope is *all* current investors remain with Tesla even if we’re private. Would create special purpose fund enabling anyone to stay with Tesla. Already do this with Fidelity’s SpaceX investment.
687,Yes
688,I don’t have a controlling vote now & wouldn’t expect any shareholder to have one if we go private. I won’t be selling in either scenario.
689,Good morning 😀

722,Good idea & thanks for Supercharger trophy reminder. Really want to make the car as fun as possible!
723,Yup
724,"Hoping to include last three in this release, with pole position linked to actual car steering wheel (while stationary tbc haha)"
725,We will try to squeeze it in
726,What are your favorites?
727,Yes
728,Yes
729,Yes
730,Some of best classic @Atari games coming as Easter eggs in Tesla V9.0 release in about 4 weeks. Thanks @Atari!
731,Falcon 9 launches Iridium to orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base   …
732,Tragic. Will send Einhorn a box of short shorts to comfort him through this difficult time.
733,And most of remaining 0.14% is Jupiter. We are tiny dust on tiny dust.
734,Science ♥️🔬💫   …
735,Oh yeah? I’ll see ur expert & raise you a Chris McKay @NASA 🌏🚀👨‍🔬 😀  …
736,Tesla body shops are ramping up fast. Aiming to go from 30+ days using external body repair shops to same day body repair with prestocked parts at Tesla service centers.
737,Will leave any comment on actions in Flint to those in Flint
738,Can’t wait to bring Tesla to Brazil. One of my favorite countries!
739,We should be really worried about this
740,No
741,"Yeah, Model 3 is designed to fit 6’4”  adults comfortably in both front & rear seats at same time"
742,"We’re adding a “party & camper mode” soon to S/3/X, so your car can maintain air flow, temp, selective lights, music & power devices for 48 hours or more while parked. Big batteries rock …"
743,"Not having a big gas guzzler engine in front means there’s room for trunks in front & back, plus longer crumple zone for best safety of any midsize car  …"
744,Hard drive industry is hardcore. They build >100 million units per year with extreme precision & brutal economics. Great background.
745,"There’s a massive amount of CO2 on Mars adsorbed into soil that’d be released upon heating. With enough energy via artificial or natural (sun) fusion, you can terraform almost any large, rocky body."
746,"Yes, minifloats"
747,Yes
748,"We tried out a new delivery system using an enclosed trailer straight from factory to owner’s home, so super convenient & car arrives in pristine condition without wasting plastic wrap  …"
749,"Was listening to Jon Hopkins’ Singularity with c, but posted this instead"
750,  …
751,"Have wanted to for so long, but that would be irresponsible"
752,All are important. You will see.
753,8-bit floating point?

764,This is great.
765,Thanks Phil
766,Machines that go “ping”
767,What’s technology?
768,"Worth another retweet. Hope Dan Neil returns to Twitter. He left due to relentless attacks from short-sellers, who constantly peddle fear, uncertainty & doubt about Tesla. Dan won the Pulitzer & is considered by many to be the best car critic in the world.  …"
769,Explains why there are so many cat videos
770,Localized electro-magnetic field generators
771,Thanks for taking a chance on @SpaceX so many years ago! Looking forward to using the new Iridium constellation.
772,Wagnerian  …
773,Yes
774,Mötor Trēnd  …
775,Great!
776,We’ve gone from ~1000 S/X deliveries per week in US last year to ~6000 S/3/X. It’s like hitting a square wave.
777,"We’re trying to get rid of contracts completely. Should just be “tap here & you get your car”. Then, if you don’t like it for any reason, just return it like any other product."
778,Yeah. Never seen it so high ever.
779,"Wow, that’s really awesome. Thank you! ♥️@TeslaOwnersUK"
780,Haha
781,"Looks good, but so many details need to be right. Journey back from hypersonic becomes extremely difficult as velocity increases. Altitude is easy, velocity is hard."
782,Only costs that actually apply to Q3 & beyond will be counted. It would not be correct to apply historical cost savings to current quarter.
783,Wall Street  …
784,Congratulations to all teams in the student @Hyperloop competition! To make high-speed pods that can operate in vacuum is very difficult. Was great to meet everyone!
785,"Exactly. Overheat protection is always on, but you can also tap “maintain” & your car will hold a cool or warm temp for a few hours while parked."
786,"Yes, Tesla Model S, X & 3 all automatically keep cabin temperature within safe limits even when parked  …"
787,Ok
788,"Makes me very sad indeed, but also the fault is mine by far"
789,He’s a good guy
790,Always look on the bright side of life …
791,It is much better
792,Sorry 🤗
793,🦄💨✌️   
794,I love that scene
795,I made that up tbh. They did not have phones during the French Revolution. They used Friendster.
796,Don’t make me bite my thumb at you
797,For sure
798,"Btw, 1792 is calling & wants its method of execution back. Seriously, what museum do you plan to raid?"
799,"Yeah, great point. Underground power lines would clear up the skyline, be safer to service, have better uptime & save lives of many birds."
800,No kidding  …
801,"Yes, that will probably be its first use"
802,"Phew 😅. Yeah, we had a drain block 3 months ago & people are working hard to make Tesla successful. Am honored to work with them. Are you trolling for fun or is it part of a job? What motivates you?"
803,I apologized. Do you stand by your guillotine statement or not?
804,"Figuratively, literally or both?"
805,That has always been our goal
806,"This chart only shows globally competed commercial launches, not US government missions. “Other US” refers to Boeing & Lockheed. Their skill at obtaining govt contracts & subsidies vastly exceeds ours."
807,"Dunno where this bs is coming from. Who knows about the future, but last week we had over 2000 S/X and 5000 Model 3 *new* net orders."
808,Definitely. We gave up some grip & width in exchange for range. Would recommend stickier tires & wider on rear for best performance. You might get 3.3 sec 0-60 mph or better with optimized rims & tires.
809,"Wow, someone has really thought about this!"
810,I wish  …
811,"Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone."
812,"As this well-written article suggests, my words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths & suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness & according to specifications from the dive team leader."
813,Good point
814,I have never donated to a SuperPAC
815,"Yes, about 0.5% of what I donated to @SierraClub, which is a reasonable amount to maintain an open dialogue"
816,Reports that I am a top donor to GOP are categorically false. I am not a top donor to any political party.
817,Thank you for fighting climate change. This affects every living creature on Earth.  …
818,"That said, I do not actually see the checks (changed that policy today). A nominal annual amount goes out automatically to both parties to maintain dialogue. I have given vastly more to humanitarian causes."
819,So that they are willing to listen when I call to object about issues that negatively affect humanity
820,"Thanks Jack. To be clear, I am not a conservative. Am registered independent & politically moderate. Doesn’t mean I’m moderate about all issues. Humanitarian issues are extremely important to me & I don’t understand why they are not important to everyone."
821,Actually true
822,Hold up a mirror & see if it fogs
823,"I’m honored to work with an amazing group of people at Tesla, but always happy to talk to an ace who might want to join"
824,Safe to lick. I checked.
825,In a month or so
826,"Will check with our cat, Schrödinger, but I don’t think she’s going to like it"
827,Spoiler alert. Next thing you’ll tell me is they don’t like pajamas.
828,Feels like a show & tell weekend. I wonder what the cat dragged in …
829,Don’t be too quick to lick. That could go wrong. Look closely & smell first. Ur welcome.

845,"They should go where their heart takes them, but some of the boys seem to be interested in physics & engineering"
846,"With my team after a profoundly interesting discussion of history, philosophy & luck with Vice President Wang in 中南海紫光阁 "
847,Excellent meetings with senior leaders in China. Very thoughtful about the long-term future.
848,Would love to. It’s been too long.
849,Prob early next year
850,Just finished an amazing 3 day visit to China. The world has never seen human energy & vigor at such scale. Incredibly impressed with Tesla China team & potential for the future.
851,Sure 🌌 💫
852,"Look, at least it’s not the Magellanic Clouds. They’re basically next door."
853,"Just between us, I have a teleportation stargate to the Andromeda galaxy. It’s amazing.  …"
854,So true  …
855,The pumps I saw were running v high flow rate all the way from cave 3. They stopped shortly after boys were rescued & water level rose to roof level all way back to cave 1. That was great work.
856,Sounds good
857,Glad to hear that. Engineering team also getting feedback from the British dive team on how to improve the design for future applications.
858,It will happen for sure. Damn.
859,Should drive temp to target. Why fan speed on app?
860,Lots of fake accounts on Twitter characterized by high following/follower ratio to make it seem like many real people when it isn’t. Wonder why.
861,"Damn, now I want donuts 🍩"
862,Yeah
863,Good point. Maybe use non-plumbers with work inspected/approved by pros.
864,"You’re right on both counts. Most houses in Flint have safe water, but they’ve lost faith in govt test results. Some houses are still outliers. Will organize a weekend in Flint to add filters to those houses with issues & hopefully fix perception of those that are actually good."
865,Maybe rewarding to organize a barnstorming weekend for water filter installation?
866,"For now, reply to my tweet with ppm & ppb test results & will send someone to install a water filter. Creating email flint@x.com, but I’m in China so that won’t be working until tomorrow."
867,Please consider this a commitment that I will fund fixing the water in any house in Flint that has water contamination above FDA levels. No kidding.
868,Great move
869,Why sir … 😊
870,Stockholm: it’s not just a syndrome
871,Good point
872,"Definitely. Can’t wait to try that. Been a little distracted past few months on mostly Tesla matters, but back at it soon."
873,"Yes, and springy, like a highly damped trampoline"
874,Well … it looked smaller on paper
875,"Catching rocket fairings falling from space has proven tricky, so we made the net really big  …"
876,"Yes. Caves are now filled with water again. Difficulty of passage is massively dependent on water level. Little kids can walk/swim in when low, but it can be deadly to pro divers when high. Pump & generator engineering team deserves some credit for the rescue."
877,It sometimes feels like reality is a moral filter. I suppose that is what religion tells us. Wonder what I should do differently.
878,Makes a lot of sense
879,This reaction has shaken my opinion of many people. We were asked to create a backup option & worked hard to do so. Checked with dive team many times to confirm it was worthwhile. Now it’s there for anyone who needs it in future. Something’s messed up if this is not a good thing.
880,I think the person who attacked me on Twitter will survive somehow
881,Thanks for correcting me. I meant to say over half a million people.
882,Please lmk contamination levels of any kind when you test the water
883,Please lmk results of your water tests
884,"When you’re there next week, are you planning to test water sources for lead?"
885,Should be very soon. We’ve already made around 100 Model 3 Performance cars for test drives in stores.
886,Exactly
887,"No, it means I created jobs for 50,000 people directly and, through parts suppliers & supporting professions, ~250,000 people indirectly, thus supporting half a million families. What have you done?"
888,Already have
889,"Ironically, the “billionaire” label, when used by media, is almost always meant to devalue & denigrate the subject. I wasn’t called that until my companies got to a certain size, but reality is that I still do the same science & engineering as before. Just the scale has changed."
890,"Good for rescuing vulnerable patients in dangerous environments, particularly if water, toxic gas or dangerous bacteria/viruses present, as patient would remain dry & at std air pressure entire time."
891,"Yes, it was specifically designed to pass that point"
892,"Moreover, based on extensive cave video review & discussion with several divers who know journey, SpaceX engineering is absolutely certain that mini-sub can do entire journey & demonstrate at any time."
893,"The former Thai provincial governor (described inaccurately as “rescue chief”) is not the subject matter expert. That would be Dick Stanton, who co-led the dive rescue team. This is our direct correspondence: "
894,Great news that they made it out safely. Congratulations to an outstanding rescue team!
895,Ok
896,Just returned from Cave 3. Mini-sub is ready if needed. It is made of rocket parts & named Wild Boar after kids’ soccer team. Leaving here in case it may be useful in the future. Thailand is so beautiful.
897,That would be cool. I wonder what it’s like under all that ice.
898,A second one that is 30cm shorter is almost complete
899,Yes. Those videos are from this morning.
900,"According to divers who have made the passage, yes. However, we also made an exact replica that is inflatable, so that the entire path can be tested without risk of blockage."
901,Simulating maneuvering through a narrow passage
902,"Thanks, but we’ve not done anything useful yet. It is all other people."
903,"According to divers who have made the journey, this is capable of maneuvering through all passages"
904,Tube diameter is 31cm
905,"Mini-sub arriving in about 17 hours. Hopefully useful. If not, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
906,Thanks @palicharterhigh for letting us use your pool
907,It is an honor to work with them
908,"With some mods, this could also work as an escape pod in space"
909,I want to know who is running the Etherium scambots! Mad skillz …
910,It is both alarming & explanatory that you run a psych ward
911,"Diver weight belts wrapped around outside. Mini-sub only weighs ~40kg dry, so easy to carry on long dry sections of cave, then add weight belts for wet sections."
912,"Yeah, that sounds cool. Music makes things better. Calms the mind. Adding padded wall pockets for a hand radio & phone/music player."
913,"Aluminum shell has high thermal conductivity, so will be close to ambient. If ambient is cold, a thin layer of neoprene insulation around interior will keep occupant warm."
914,Buoyancy adjusted by strapping diver weight belts around body of capsule. They’re prevented from sliding off by the 6 diver handhold attachments.
915,"Testing for 3 more hours in LA, then it’s on a plane to Thailand"
916,"Design based on dive team feedback (primarily Stanton): 4 air / oxygen ports front & rear, front ports protected by nosecone. Dual O-ring seal on acrylic rear plate with clear view of occupant head. Leak/buckling proof to 10X cave water pressure."
917,I am an engineer
918,Tight control code is always C
919,Python is done right. Great name story too.
920,"If I am a narcissist (which might be true), at least I am a useful one"
921,🖤🖤🖤 Python 🖤🖤🖤
922,Pretty close. There is a nosecone on the front to protect against rocks impacting fwd air hoses with a hole on the side for hoses to exit.
923,Turbo
924,C
925,"Given Chiang Rai airport hours, soonest we could’ve departed US was an hour ago, but cave now closed for diver rescue. Will continue testing in LA in case needed later or for somewhere else in future."
926,"Will do. Even if not useful here, perhaps it will be in a future situation."
927,Extremely talented dive team. Makes sense given monsoon. Godspeed.  …
928,Yes
929,Yes
930,Fitted for a kid or small adult to minimize open air. Segmented compartments to place rocks or dive weights & adjust bouyancy.
931,Yes
932,"4 handles/hitch points on front & 4 on rear. 2 air tank connections on front & 2 on rear, allowing 1 to 4 tanks simultaneously connected, all recessed for impact protection w secondary cap seal if leak develops."
933,I’m in LA working with the SpaceX team building the kid mini-sub
934,"Construction complete in about 8 hours, then 17 hour flight to Thailand"
935,"Continue to be amazed by the bravery, resilience & tenacity of kids & diving team in Thailand. Human character at its best."
936,"Got more great feedback from Thailand. Primary path is basically a tiny, kid-size submarine using the liquid oxygen transfer tube of Falcon rocket as hull. Light enough to be carried by 2 divers, small enough to get through narrow gaps. Extremely robust."
937,Ground winds would
938,Yes. All-weather. ~300km/h high altitude winds. ~60km/h ground winds. It’s a beast.
939,Can’t be too buoyant
940,"Some good feedback from cave experts in Thailand. Iterating with them on an escape pod design that might be safe enough to try. Also building an inflatable tube with airlocks. Less likely to work, given tricky contours, but great if it does."
941,Good idea
942,"Prob wise to add an air tank (butt end fwd to take impacts) in nose of pod & vent valve in rear. Set air tank to slow bleed rate, then no need for SCUBA mouthpiece or regulator. Training unnecessary & less susceptible to panic attack."
943,You’re welcome. Happy birthday! 🎁🎉🎂
944,"Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about in that tweet — double-layer Kevlar pressure pod with Teflon coating. Other approach is a long inflatable air sock. Both worth trying."
945,Exactly. You can put socks on your feet the same way. There would be no relative motion between the tube & rock wall.
946,It’s open so that others who are closer to the problem can consider this as one possible solution
947,"Should be possible to increase the air inflow rate above the leak rate, unless there is a very big hole. If oxygen % is dropping, suggests that leak holes are not large."
948,I would def recommend this
949,Building double-layer Kevlar pressure pods with Teflon coating to slip by rocks & front/rear rope tow hitch & lead pockets for neutral buoyancy. ~60 cm oval. Testing this aft in a pool with a subject who has never done SCUBA. Do the divers think something like this might work?
950,Interesting
951,"Great, thanks"
952,Inflatable tubes & pods being made out of Kevlar for better abrasion resistance. A SpaceX engineer happens to be in Thailand & is headed there now. Could one of the divers DM me? Need approx contour of most difficult sections for tube fab.
953,"So long as air pressure in tube higher than water pressure, air will blow out & water won’t come in"
954,"Does you know output voltage & amperage of those generator trucks? 3 phase? What frequency? Will need high voltage transformer to carry power over distance or very thick cable. Beyond that, only batteries will work. Will prep Powerwalls in case needed."
955,SpaceX & Boring Co engineers headed to Thailand tomorrow to see if we can be helpful to govt. There are probably many complexities that are hard to appreciate without being there in person.
956,"Looks like 1st bit of water is close enough to entrance to be pumped out. 2nd & 3rd would need battery packs, air pumps & tubes. If depth of 2nd is accurate, would need ~0.5 bar tube pressure. Prob need to enter tube, zip up & then transit."
957,"So long as air feed rate exceeds leak rate, tube remains inflated. This is how bouncy castles or inflatable mazes work. Needs very little power as the work (physics def of work) done is low. Pumping out water faster than it enters the cave system is prob 10X to 1000X more power."
958,Have a small velcro slit entrance & exit in circumferential direction (half stress of longitudinal direction)
959,"Walking speed is around 5km/h, but if you’re in an air tube, time doesn’t matter much. If tube diameter was 1.5m, a fast walk of 5km would take 40 mins or so. Just need to duck for the narrow sections."
960,Maybe worth trying: insert a 1m diameter nylon tube (or shorter set of tubes for most difficult sections) through cave network & inflate with air like a bouncy castle. Should create an air tunnel underwater against cave roof & auto-conform to odd shapes like the 70cm hole.
961,Exactly. A journalist who publicly expresses love for & parties in Vegas with a prominent shortseller of any given company should disclose this when writing articles.
962,"I know you & believe you, but it means Lopez misled readers in her article, because that is exactly what she said"
963,I didn’t ask anyone and the people who sent the snapshots don’t work for me. They just don’t like hypocrites.
964,They were sent to me by multiple people on the Internet. I don’t use Facebook.
965,Lopez wrote that Melissa Lee of CNBC was “dancing her face off” with Chanos in Vegas. Is this true?  …
966,Why did @lopezlinette publish a love letter puff piece about Chanos’s cuff links? Who took the pic? Obv not objective  …
967,.@Lopezlinette posted on social media that she was partying in Vegas with Chanos & Tepper with caption “Love both these dudes”. Doesn’t sound very objective  …
968,"Norwegians are right to be upset with Tesla. We are having trouble expanding our service facilities in Oslo especially. Can solve quickly with Tesla mobile service vans, but awaiting govt permission to do so."
969,Are you 100% certain that @businessinsider stands by @lopezlinette & supports everything she’s done? Why won’t Lopez go on record saying that she never offered Tripp anything for inside info or asked him to break his confidentiality agreement by taking detailed video of Tesla IP?
970,Sounds fishy. How did that go down?
971,True
972,"So @lopezlinette publicly stated she stans for Chanos, Tesla’s most prominent short-seller. In her words, he is “one of the greatest.” Her articles print Chanos’s view verbatim. This is not journalism."
973,".@lopezlinette You stated publicly that you “see eye to eye” with Chanos, the most prominent short-seller of Tesla. Have you ever provided him with material non-public information about Tesla?"
974,What a coincidence …
975,Am not attacking all media or even all of @CNBC. Just asked if you inform public about an analyst’s prediction track record about a subject when putting them on your show.
976,"Indeed, very simple question. To be specific: @lopezlinette, did you compensate or promise to compensate Martin Tripp for inside information about Tesla? Did he, under that inducement, provide you with exaggerated negative info, which you printed, but turned out to be untrue?"
977,"Exactly. @cnbc, I just asked a simple question. Please answer."
978,"Strange. @cnbc, is it true that you are putting on analysts with such low ratings & extremely bad prediction records? Are your viewers informed about an analyst’s track record before hearing their opinion."
979,"Note, no one is in the car or controlling remotely. Car is driving entirely by itself.  …"
980,"Sounds very sketchy if true. @lopezlinette, is it possible you’re  serving as an inside trading source for one of Tesla’s biggest short-sellers? An ex-Tesla employee just went on record formally claiming you bribed him & he sent you valuable Tesla IP in exchange. Is this true?"
981,"@lopezlinette has published several false articles about Tesla, including a doozy where she claimed Tesla scrapped more batteries than our total S,X &3 production number, which is physically impossible."
982,"Wow, so @sal19 of @Reuters wrote article that misled public about Model 3 production & followed that up with mean tweet to me on my bday. Nice work @sal19 & @Reuters."
983,".@Reuters, why did you mislead the people public about this number?"
984,".@Reuters is relentlessly negative about Tesla. They just wrote a bogus article saying S production last week was low by 800 cars. S/X annual prod is set at ~100k, ie 1,900/week. Tesla built 1,913 S/X cars at our standard ~50/50 split last week, which is right on target."
985,Happy to support
986,"Boring Co has advanced ground penetrating radar & is pretty good at digging holes. Don’t know if pump rate is limited by electric power or pumps are too smal. If so, could dropship fully charged Powerpacks and pumps."
987,Belfast is beautiful
988,"No, was just there with my kids for a few hours to see the GoT set & had dinner at a pub. Love the show and GRRM’s books."
989,Should be coming soon
990,I will buy tons of your merch
991,"Very early on, we had the ability to use the car as a battery outputting power. Maybe worth revisiting that."

993,"Ok, will look into it"

1040,"No standard automotive solution could be built in time, so we created a new solution. It is working & has slightly higher quality than the more traditional general assembly line. Perhaps most surprising is that the total cost of production in the Sprung tent is lower."
1041,All Tesla vehicles come with cabin overheat protection  …
1042,I hate whole idea of brands and branding. So much bs. I hope it messes with our brand. Brands suck.

1045,For sure
1046,Should be easy to add as a feature like calendar

1055,"Pickup truck will have power outlets allowing use of heavy duty 240V, high power tools in field all day. No generator needed."
1056,The Tesla Truck will have dual motor all-wheel drive w crazy torque & a suspension that dynamically adjusts for load. Those will be standard.
1057,It will parallel park automatically & have 360 degree cameras & sonar
1058,"What would you love to see in a Tesla pickup truck? I have a few things in mind, but what do you think are small, but important nuances & what would be seriously next level?"
1059,"“Virtue signaling” is super annoying & there are lots of phoneys who are actually huge jerks, but jump on every social cause du jour. But I’m really proud of the fact that # of changes Tesla had to make to achieve 100/100 (before even knowing about the LGBTQ index) was zero."
1060,Don’t buy our car if that’s a problem. People should be free to live their lives where their heart takes them ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤💖🌈
1061,Then you will really hate that Tesla scored 100/100 four years in a row on LGBTQ equality  …
1062,We must aspire to truth
1063,Important to read the Wash Post article. The “unable to account for” number does not refer to actual lost children. It refers to calls not answered or returned in a 30 day period.
1064,Hopefully in V9.0 release in a few months
1065,True
1066,"We should always be concerned about the welfare of children & those who cannot protect themselves, wherever they may be, but it seems much of the reporting on this issue has been partisan & often inaccurate"
1067,"“… of the 7,635 children, 6,075 remained where they were placed, 52 had moved, 28 had run away and five were deported. That left 1,475 migrant children. Just because their parents or guardians did not return HHS’s phone calls after 30 days does not mean the children are missing”"
1068,"“All 7,635 children were resettled by HHS. After 30 days, the department called the parents or guardians to check up on things. But these calls were not required by law, and in 1,475 cases, the parents or guardians did not respond”"
1069,This Washington Post article seems good  …
1070,"As individuals, we will all die in blink of an eye on a galactic timescale. What can live on for long time is civilization. Those who first go to other planets will face far more risk of death & hardship than those who stay. Over time, space travel will be safe & open to all."
1071,"This doesn’t take into account shifting trillions of tons of carbon from subsurface to atmosphere, which could accelerate overheating time by a factor of a million (or so). This is why Tesla."
1072,"A billion at most, so 20% max. Still basically in the nick of time from an age-of-Earth standpoint."
1073,"Humanity is not perfect, but it’s all we’ve got"

1083,"Critical autonomous safety features like emergency braking are standard, but convenience features like active cruise control are not"
1084,"It’s a tough call. Reality is that it will be pretty easy to bully a self-driving car, as it will always yield. Will prob have a manual override that requires continuous press for hardcore lane changes."

1115,"That would be tricky to sequence, but maybe"
1116,Was thinking of offering an extended Tesla factory tour option where you could help build part of a car & understand how they come together. I know it would have been super fun for me when I was a kid (or now).
1117,It’s called Top Secret
1118,Yes
1119,"When I was a kid, I built model airplanes, trainsets, rockets (mixed my own powder), explosives (kinda surprised I still have all fingers), a radio, lots of software. Built a primitive MRI machine in college."
1120,"Yeah, but I’m not sure what the big deal is. I like building things. If that ends up being useful work too, even better."
1121,We will add a config to lower the alert
1122,Apply light force to the steering wheel. Alert is being changed to this text.
1123,Try saying “bug report”. Might work better. Ironic if the bug report about bug reports isn’t working :)
1124,"Thanks for the feedback, will investigate"
1125,Sure
1126,Congratulations!
1127,It’s actually pretty fun building electric cars. Product is useful to other people & good for environment. I think that’s fundamental goodness.

1134,@Money23Green Thanks for coming by our car factory with @westcoastbill. Tesla team was super fired up to see you! Congrats on your victory!!
1135,"Crazy, that was over 22 years ago. Thanks for believing in us!"
1136,"There is more, but the actions of a few bad apples will not stop Tesla from reaching its goals. With 40,000 people, the worst 1 in 1000 will have issues. That’s still ~40 people."
1137,Today. It’s kinda there in US with welfare but rules are messed up and amount is too low.
1138,Also think there should be a universal basic income that doesn’t change even if you get a job. Productivity should be rewarded.
1139,Because honey is a vegetable
1140,Considerably less so than our competitors (longer discussion)
1141,"Yes, consumption tax is way better. Also, higher estate tax better than income/cap gains tax. Probability of progeny being equally excellent at capital allocation is not high."
1142,Exactly
1143,"He’s obv wrong. Forcing function for any 100% mkt share monopolist to improve is weak & a national govt is that by fiat. One may find lowish correlation for negativity, but that does not mean low causation."
1144,Great name. A little on the nose.
1145,"That’s really decision about how good you think govt is at allocating capital. Buffett, for example, is vastly better than any govt at allocating capital. Consumption vs capital allocation extremely misunderstood. Biggest missing piece in public understanding of what “money” is."
1146,"Yeah, all-inclusive tax rate of 40% seems about right. Below 30% is unrealistic for critical govt functions unless national defense is de facto outsourced & above 50% too negatively affects economic output."
1147,Cool video  …
1148,Thank you for helping those in need  …

1170,You’re probably right. Maybe after Tesla drama calms down.
1171,I’m at the factory a lot. Pretty good workout just walking around. It’s big.
1172,They look beautiful
1173,Will maybe do a media tour next week. Team deserves recognition. This was miraculous.
1174,It’s actually way better than the factory building. More comfortable & a great view of the mountains.
1175,Not sure we actually need a building. This tent is pretty sweet. Tesla Grohmann line is in place at Giga & spooling up now. They super kicked ass too. Heiliger Strohsack!
1176,They also poured the concrete & built the whole assembly line using scrap we had in warehouses. And it’s way better than the other GA line that cost hundreds of millions!
1177,No
1178,"Needed another general assembly line to reach 5k/week Model 3 production. A new building was impossible, so we built a giant tent in 2 weeks. Tesla team kfa!! Gah, love them so much ♥️🚘💫"
1179,"You’re welcome, bad fiction writer 78 "
1180,"Dude, we are California, which is extremely pro union. People can form a union tomorrow & nothing Tesla could do to stop it. UAW can’t even get enough sigs to request a vote, cause they have nothing to offer."
1181,Your union brothers  …
1182,You won’t find pro-union either. The books are all about freedom. No one is forced to join any organization.
1183,"Thanks, good advice"
1184,They have about three weeks before their short position explodes
1185,Good points. Already mostly working in the developer software I’m driving.
1186,Can’t wait for the new @RickandMorty season to start!
1187,"We’ve always provided healthcare, hourly wages above union & Tesla stock. Also, free drinks & snacks. Try to make it fun too. Top ten hourly workers cumulatively received Tesla stock now worth $1M to $2M. Nobody wants UAW, so UAW keeps trashing Tesla & me via 3rd parties."
1188,Glad you teach physics. That and critical thinking (ie how not to be tricked) are foundational for all kids to learn.
1189,"Yeah, I think we pretty much agree. Btw, great show."
1190,"I think essential services, incl health care, should be taken care of by govt/taxpayers (socialist) & other parts of economy should be served by companies competing to serve the people (capitalist). Aka, the view held by most of America."
1191,They started it & attacked me personally
1192,Search UAW and “corruption”. Very long reading list. Great organization.  …
1193,“Profit” just means you earned more money than you spent & certainly does spark innovation. Jesus. This is obv a good thing & extremely hard. It has taken Tesla 15 years & we’re almost there. Every other US car company besides Ford & Tesla has gone bankrupt.
1194,They don’t seem to think much or care about the future beyond a narrow horizon
1195,Engels wrote 2nd & 3rd volumes based on Marx’s “notes”. Less reliable.
1196,"Wanted to help transition the world to sustainable, clean energy and extend life as we know it beyond Earth. Those problems require a lot of hardware."
1197,"Wow, you know nothing & are worthy of contempt. The world is under massive attack due to climate change & you couldn’t care less."
1198,"Read it. Like the green, translucent Martian opal?"
1199,Iron pyrite
1200,Congratulations to LA Times and Patrick Soon-Shiong!
1201,"You’re just a troll/bot, but I will reply anyway. I arrived in Montreal at 17 by myself with $2k. No support, no contacts, nothing. Father said I’d fail & be back in 3 months."
1202,"I don’t want to see anyone lose their money. Or I will at least provide fair warning before it happens, as I have done in the past."
1203,You think all companies are bad and all unions good? That’s a very bigoted position.
1204,Well said  …
1205,Then you’ll be fine
1206,Exactly. Our NDA is actually shorter & simpler than most.
1207,"...which clearly doesn’t work. UAW and Wall Street shorts know every detail of what’s happening at Tesla. Storm clouds are gathering, so they’re getting desperate."
1208,"Then look a little closer, doctorow. Read the whole thread."
1209,More propaganda. The NDA only prevents disclosure of Tesla proprietary IP or material non-public information (insider trading).
1210,How big is your short position? Just curious.
1211,Union flyers are handed out all the time in the factory. I know because people in the factory laugh at the ridiculous propaganda & hand them to me. This one guy’s claim about being stopped once in a parking lot is false and irrelevant.
1212,"I endorse freedom to form a union too, as well as freedom not to do so if they feel Tesla is a good company. UAW has major conflicts of interest & failed our car plant already when they abandoned us in 2010. Tesla can only hire 5% of applicants, so must be doing something right."
1213,"UAW doesn’t have 30% of signatures (about 6000 people) needed for a vote. They can’t even muster enough people for a free bbq. Instead, they’re getting paid trolls & far left shills to trash Tesla & me in press & social media. Such creeps."
1214,"I’m not against all unions, but UAW has a track record of destroying productivity so a company can’t compete on world market. Our current factory went bankrupt under UAW before we took it over. Don’t want Tesla to die too."
1215,"I am too, of sorts. Govt (ie other taxpayers) should take care of critical needs of people, incl defense, judiciary, health care, etc. Rest should be companies competing to provide best product or service to the people."
1216,"Was originally called Puff the Magic Dragon, as people said I was high if though it could work, so I named it after their insult."
1217,"Iain certainly wasn’t pro-union in the Culture books. At all. And wouldn’t be in the case of Tesla. Banks was about freedom through & through. Maybe for a single buyer (monopsony) vs single seller (monopoly), I would be too, but that’s a special case."

1238,"If I’m not a communist, why do I make red cars 🚘 🤔"
1239,"Very appealing if you’re a sophomore in college. It’s a counterpoint to communism and useful as such, but should be tempered with kindness."
1240,That is why it is critical to support competition. Excess profits draw in competitors who then drive down prices.
1241,lol
1242,"Read Das Kapital when I was 14, incl cross-checking English translation of original German. Adam Smith FTW obv. Ironically, future automation will naturally lead to greater equality of consumption. Monopolies are true enemy of people. Competing to serve is good."
1243,Might actually be his!
1244,Amazing work by Tesla team. Built entire new general assembly line in 3 weeks w minimal resources. Love u guys so much! Pic of 1st Model 3 dual motor performance coming off the line …
1245,You’re a docile puppet of the UAW. Be honest about what you are.
1246,Yes
1247,Sigh
1248,"By the way, I am actually a socialist. Just not the kind that shifts resources from most productive to least productive, pretending to do good, while actually causing harm. True socialism seeks greatest good for all."
1249,“No sense of humor” is certainly proving itself true. Good grief! How many socialists does it take to screw in a lightbulb?  Answer: That’s not funny!!

1252,"Heading back into the factory, so that’s enough for now. Don’t take my Tweet too seriously. For one thing, it’s called a “Tweet”."
1253,No
1254,My father has no money. Only reason he even has a house is because my brother & I bought it for him on condition that he not cause harm to others. That obviously failed.
1255,"There is considerable confusion between wealth as consumption & wealth as labor allocation. By latter measure, anyone in govt whose budget exceeds $1B is a billionaire. Government is the largest corporation."

1261,What is yours?
1262,What is your utopia?
1263,The future is a set of branching probability streams. Some actions by humanity have an extremely leveraged effect on shape & size of those streams.
1264,Strongly disagree. I love humanity.
1265,"Already did. Meant to go longer, but ran out of time. "
1266,I always wanted to do a terms & conditions cover of Green Eggs & Ham
1267,Foundation Series & Zeroth Law are fundamental to creation of SpaceX
1268,I love Banks. Best books in recent years imo are Iain Banks & George Martin.
1269,"Given how bad I am at poetry, probably Vogon"
1270,Should prob articulate philosophy underlying my actions. It’s pretty simple & mostly influenced by Douglas Adams & Isaac Asimov.
1271,My donations are anonymous
1272,Already sold >$100M TSLA for charity. Will do about that every few years. Major disbursements in about 20 years when Tesla is steady state.
1273,"My “pay” is in options, which only matter if stock goes up & I sell. Will use that to make life multiplanetary, help education & environment on Earth w my foundation. Just don’t want us to be sad about the future.  …"

1276,"Yes, interface will change with Version 9 software"
1277,"Will be adjusting screen alert to clarify that we mean “slight up or downward force on the wheel”, not really “hold the wheel”"
1278,"Some very, very tough calls. Had to let go of good people, but I think they will find new jobs quickly."
1279,"Difficult, but necessary Tesla reorg underway. My email to the company has already leaked to media. Here it is unfiltered: "
1280,That is actual footage
1281,Back in the Precambrian era when the main form of life was a sponge
1282,Thanks! Have heard universally great things about your podcasts.
1283,"Of course, but it’s the kind of hustle that you like even with full knowledge. People can obv read the Internet & anyone who wants a refund will get one. I predict basically zero. The honest-to-goodness fun value is amazing & we’re never going to make them again."
1284,"Trade is just that Roadster becomes a 2 seater instead of a 2+2. COPV in place of the kid seats, which is prob wise for many reasons"
1285,"Exactly. Total energy stored even in ultra compressed air is low vs battery, but power output is insane. The composite overwrapped pressure vessel (COPV) is most advanced ever made. It’s what SpaceX is qualifying for NASA crewed missions. Extremely robust — literally bulletproof."
1286,Not recommended for urban environments
1287,Yes
1288,"The actual amount of time I spend on Twitter is tiny. My tweets are literally what I’m thinking at the moment, not carefully crafted corporate bs, which is really just banal propaganda."
1289,It is amazingly hard to find a simple solution. A complicated one is relatively easy.
1290,Love this design. Simpler the better.
1291,Add an R for Roadster 👽💕🚀
1292,"Sigh. This is crux of matter: can’t make system too annoying or people won’t use it, negatively affecting safety, but also can’t allow people to get too complacent or safety again suffers. Latest update should have a positive effect on latter issue especially."
1293,A lot of people whose judgment I respect have suggested this. Sounds like a good idea. Will do so after Model 3 production reaches 5k/week steady.
1294,"Yes. Hopefully, I’m not tempting fate too much with that date. It was meant as a joke, but is about the right actual timing."
1295,Will do
1296,"Correct, pure electric. Wish orbital rockets could be so too, but there’s no escaping Newton’s Third Law. SpaceX is already developing high efficiency CO2 capture with H2O to form liquid CH4 (methane) & O2. Critical for propellant production at Mars Base Alpha."
1297,"You have my word, Marques. Next gen Roadster will be absolutely out of this world. For those who love to drive, there is no finer car in history and we don’t think there will be another."
1298,"Note, gas contained would be ultra high pressure air in a SpaceX rocket COPV bottle. The air exiting the thrusters would immediately be replenished whenever vehicle pack power draw allowed operation of the air pump, which is most of the time."
1299,"Intent of new Tesla Roadster is to beat gas sports cars on every performance metric by far, no exceptions, thus transferring the “halo crown” effect gas cars have as the top speed leaders over to pure electric."
1300,"That issue is better in latest Autopilot software rolling out now & fully fixed in August update as part of our long-awaited Tesla Version 9. To date, Autopilot resources have rightly focused entirely on safety. With V9, we will begin to enable full self-driving features."
1301,"This is why I’m not impressed when reporters who were literally in junior high while I was in newsrooms all round the world say that if I only knew how newsrooms really worked, then I’d know everything’s fine & no need for a media credibility rating system like Pravduh 🤔"
1302,"Zip2 also built a newspaper publishing platform that brought hundreds of regional & city papers online for the first time, and made major functionality advancements to the NY Times, Boston Globe & Knight-Ridder websites. NYT, KR & Hearst were all major investors in Zip2."
1303,20 years of intense programming on extremely weak CPUs with nothing for memory & a straw for bandwidth tends to burn itself onto your 🧠 like a branding iron. Can still remember trying to squeeze fractions of a millisecond out of the /?€}%$& fetch_joystick_state function.
1304,"In early 90s, I wrote a multitasker for PCs that spoofed the CPU & CD-ROM to act in parallel, so could read video continuously while player sprite moved smoothly. Required C++, assembly & direct flipping of CPU registers. That company’s name was Rocket Science. Fate loves irony."
1305,"That’s quite a blast from the past! After my Zip2 experience w patents, I felt that patents (particularly software) inhibited innovation, instead of fostering it. I aspired to file zero patents after that. In 2014, we open-sourced all Tesla patents  …"
1306,"At Zip2, I wrote entire V1 of software for drawing vector maps & calculating point to point directions anywhere in US (first ever company to do so), as well as white pages & business listings w reviews (an early Yelp). Also wrote V1 of classifieds, autotrading & real estate apps."
1307,"More background: I arrived in North America at 17 w $2000, a backpack & a suitcase full of books. Paid my own way thru college. Dropped out of Stanford Eng/Phys grad school w $110k in college debt. Created Internet startup w bro & Greg Khouri (love bro & loved Greg, may he RIP)"

1309,"Using the config you describe, plus an electric pump to replenish air in COPV, when car power draw drops below max pack power output, makes sense. But we are going to go a lot further."
1310,"19 years ago, when my 1st company got bought, I had to decide between buying a house in Palo Alto or a McLaren F1 (best car ever imo). Was no contest. I bought F1 & a small condo that was much cheaper than the car. New Tesla Roadster will exceed all gas sports cars in every way…"
1311,"SpaceX option package for new Tesla Roadster will include ~10 small rocket thrusters arranged seamlessly around car. These rocket engines dramatically improve acceleration, top speed, braking & cornering. Maybe they will even allow a Tesla to fly …"
1312,"Terms & conditions for “Not-a-Flamethrower”  Please use as directed to avoid unintentionally burning things down. For simple & concise instructions, we drew upon wisdom in great Dr Seuss book “Green Eggs and Ham”.   #ThrowFlamesResponsibly "
1313,"Almost forgot! Due to recent regulatory/customs rules enacted to inhibit transport of anything called a Flamethrower, we have renamed our product: “Not a Flamethrower”."
1314,Yes
1315,Each flamethrower comes with a state-of-the-art The Boring Company brand fire extinguisher.   Will offer a TBC ice blaster before the dry season starts in winter.
1316,"Flamethrower obv best way to light your fireplace/BBQ. No more need to use a dainty “match” to ignite! If no wood, just drop your flamethrower in fire place! It will generate way more warmth than a quaint pile of logs."
1317,Coming soon
1318,I think so :)
1319,Nothing makes your baby more zen than a few gentle puffs of a TBC Flamethrower
1320,First 1000 Boring Company Flamethrowers being picked up today!
1321,We’re building out Tesla body repair in all major metro areas to ensure super fast & excellent outcome
1322,Talked with Tesla team. Looks like we can do the aluminum Model 3 pedal covers (slightly different from S). Turning on production for Model 3 Performance version.
1323,Gigafactory should be on 100% renewable energy (primarily solar with some wind) by next year. Rollout of solar already begun.
1324,"Yeah, actually closer to Skylab, but with 50% larger inner diameter"
1325,And we’re definitely going to have a pod bay door override button. Lesson learned.
1326,"Definitely. Will also have Augmented Mode that will massively enhance human driving ability. Like a flying metal suit, but in car form …"
1327,Running track in @SpaceX BF Spaceship will look something like this
1328,"No plans for aluminum pedals. Adds too much production complexity. Model 3 will def have summon, which will get way more advanced for S & X w HW2 Autopilot & all Model 3 cars."
1329,Working on improving
1330,"No way 6 mins is enough for abs. I mean, come on, 7 mins is obv right."
1331,"Oh please, that’s obv overkill"
1332,Tip of the day …  …
1333,Coming soon
1334,"We are ramping production as fast as possible. Wait should be closer to 6 months though, not 2 years."
1335,Congratulations @murraymatt. Good move by @WSJ. Please use Matt’s Twitter pic. Essence of a good editor
1336,"Yup, we are extending the net area by a factor of 4"
1337,"Am def not under any illusion that this will end illiteracy, but I hope it helps at least a little  …"
1338,"Good morning, Sonic. Not sure how to break it to you, but …  …"
1339,"We have about 11,000 projects underway in Puerto Rico"
1340,Appreciated on behalf of Tesla team
1341,You should get an invite to configure in next few days
1342,Definitely
1343,"Leasing negatively effects Tesla cash flow, so we prob won’t offer Model 3 leases for 6 to 9 months. Loan financing is a better deal anyway, as bank conservatism for new car models is v conservative about residual value, but Teslas have always had strong residual value."
1344,Model 3 Performance order page progressively rolling out to reservation holders over the next week or so. It’s a really great car. Not saying that lightly. Test drive is a mindwarp. Aiming to have these as our first test drive Model 3 cars in stores within 4 to 6 week’s.
1345,Next year
1346,Twitter is so dark …
1347,No … no …
1348,That is horrifying

1354,"Usually, they don’t even realize it. All they know is that some PR agency is pushing a story that will get clicks. That is the true nature of the corruption. It is rare that US media knowingly writes a false story just for clicks, but they are often manipulated into doing so."
1355,Actually true!
1356,"Singapore has enough land area to generate most of its electricity from the sun. Solar energy is more than most people realize. 250MW per sq km at current commercial efficiency solar panels. No more need to import fossil fuels for electricity, which is a strategic vulnerability."
1357,"But don’t worry, cars have been tested for emissions levels & everything’s just fine   …"
1358,"Why have policies that promote a combustion vehicle fleet in a dense city environment? In bumper to bumper traffic, each car’s exhaust pipes releases poison gases right into the air intake of car behind. This is not healthy."
1359,The results speak for themselves. Singapore is a very prosperous city and yet has very few electric cars.
1360,Glad you’re ok!  …
1361,Some details on the Tesla air filtration system  …
1362,Mid 2019 for RHD
1363,That sounds like a fun adventure!
1364,You can just take the aero inserts out of the standard wheel & it looks pretty cool. We could offer that as an option at purchase.
1365,"Model 3 should be second best in world after Model S/X. Still super good, but we went a little 🥜 on S/X."
1366,"Filters bacteria, viruses, spores, pollen & particulate of almost any kind  …"
1367,"Model S & X also have an acid gas filter, an alkaline gas filter & a carbon monoxide detector that autoswitches car to recirc mode. We should prob tell people about this more. Filters are giant, so too big to fit in Model 3."
1368,"Cool, Tesla S/X have hospital operating room air quality when BWD mode is activated, so shd protect against even a weaponized virus  …"

1377,Hi @Malala! 💕👻😅
1378,Try adjusting tire pressure. Will ask Tesla engineering to investigate.
1379,Hell of a week  …
1380,Just for perspective   …
1381,"True, no one is perfect"
1382,You’re most welcome. More to come in this regard.
1383,"Tesla will always refute articles that are misleading & point out if there is someone with a pattern of doing so. Many fit this description, but Consumer Reports is always fair & accurate in their criticism."
1384,"Ride comfort & aero/road noise already better than CR car, which was early production. Wish we could make the car perfect from day 1, but there’s always room for improvement. Highly recommend dropping tire pressure 10% below max to ~39 psi for comfort. Only affects range by ~2%."
1385,Prob 8.3
1386,Yes
1387,"All items below will go to all Model 3s within next few months with V8.2 software. To report a bug or ask for a feature, press voice button, say “bug report” followed by issue description.  …"
1388,“Pneumatic” means propelled by air. Opposite of Hyperloop.
1389,"Braking & UI upgrades apply to all Model 3s. Improved windshield for aero noise & suspension for ride comfort are major ops. Unless you’re really bothered by them, don’t replace. Best way to improve ride is drop tire pressure to ~39 psi. 45 psi is best range, but lower comfort."
1390,"Yeah, absolutely"
1391,Really appreciate the high quality critical feedback from @ConsumerReports. Road noise & ride comfort already addressed too. UI improvements coming via remote software update later this month.  …
1392,Like you guys too 🚘 🖤  …
1393,"Actually, Hyperloop draws a near vacuum in tube & each pod is powered w electric motors. It is opposite of pneumatically powered."
1394,"Would love to be in India. Some challenging government regulations, unfortunately. Deepak Ahuja, our CFO, is from India. Tesla will be there as soon as he believes we should."
1395,Good progress. Really proud of this design & SpaceX propulsion team. This engine is something special.
1396,Peace ✌️
1397,Love the space cowboy esthetic
1398,♥️
1399,"At risk of stating the extremely obvious, I am against threats of violence & abusive epithets in any forum. Please do not use them in my name or at all."
1400,"You’re saying a BBC reporter who attacked me for months w unprofessional language & ad hominem attacks, then deleted those tweets to hide them, is a “good person”?"
1401,This journalist has been attacking me for months incl using genitalia language that she now says is sexist. What a hypocrite!  …
1402,"“Nano” is a unit of measure, not a field imo. Would’ve been sexist *not* to express an opinion simply because someone is a woman."
1403,"Hello, have you met the Internet? Everyone gets harassed regardless of gender, especially if they say false things. Saying I’m against science is like saying Beyoncé doesn’t know beats. Blowback from latter (all genders) would make my comment stream seem like Socratic dialogue."
1404,"Gaiman, did you actually read my tweets? I didn’t set anyone on anyone. A BBC science reporter tweeted that I was anti-science & I said that was false. Are you saying I don’t have the right to deny false accusations? That’s messed up."
1405,"You’ve done something incredibly dishonest by supporting a journo who falsely stated that I’m against science, then cherrypicked tweets that don’t represent the vast majority of my followers to make false claims against them too"
1406,Great book. Read it when it came out.
1407,Exactly
1408,SpaceX has Area 58 at Cape Canaveral. That’s 7 better than 51.
1409,Yeah
1410,Second best answer to the Fermi Paradox after the simulation argument
1411,Which part? Love their cuisine. And the views are amazing.
1412,Yes
1413,"There are no aliens. Officially, at least …"
1414,You have so many great pics & factoids!
1415,"Yes, AWD P first and then AWD. Production costs are always high when line first gets going, so we have to sell higher price versions first or each car will have very negative margins. As production efficiency rises, we can make lower cost versions & not lose money."
1416,I really want to make this cupholder
1417,"A dream that wd prob be a nightmare in reality. Cup holder that auto adjusted for size & stiffness of cup/bottle, maintained cold or hot temp & dried off water condensation. Or I cd work on getting humanity to Mars. Tough choice."
1418,I’ve literally had dreams about cup holder designs
1419,Noted. We can prob adjust spring force & catch to be less sensitive. Cupholders are amazingly hard to get right!
1420,You’re welcome. Appreciate the letter.
1421,Good school
1422,Thank you for the lovely letter  …
1423,Had a great time with my kids
1424,Yes
1425,"Seems to be glitch where tweet to which I replied isn’t showing up, removing context. A journo said polls are meaningless because controlled by “powerful people” & my response was that powerful people also own media. Thus, if you discount polls, you should also discount media. "
1426,Thanks 😀
1427,2020
1428,Superchargers will ultimately cover the entire region
1429,"Pointing out to aspiring journo & Rodin spokesmodel, Josh Top, who thinks public polls are controlled by “powerful people” that the media is *owned* by same. Anyone who thought this was anti-Semitic is just revealing their inner bigot. The context is very clear."
1430,Thanks for offering to help. I will check with my team.
1431,You’re right. These guys can buzzkill themselves (pun intended). Signing off …
1432,Who do you think *owns* the press? Hello.
1433,You’re missing the point & living in a bubble of self-righteous sanctimony. The public doesn’t trust you. This was true *before* the last election & only got worse. Don’t believe me? Run your own poll …
1434,"You’re welcome to come by SpaceX, but please stop assuming I’m against all journalists. This is not true. Something needs to be done to improve public trust in media."
1435,You really think I haven’t spent time in a newsroom? I’ve spent time in too many. Bleak.
1436,"Sadly, it had better critical analysis than most non-cult media"
1437,"Yup, deleted"
1438,? It should
1439,"No, but dual motors mean increased regen braking & will ride tire traction limit. You won’t notice sport brakes unless you’re on a racetrack & have the sticky 20” tires."
1440,"Also, firmware fix for upgraded brake performance on standard Model 3 started rolling out yesterday. Should improve braking distance by ~20 ft for repeated heavy braking events. Thanks @ConsumerReports for excellent critical feedback!"
1441,"Yes, Model 3 Performance will have red calipers & sport level brakes"
1442,Keyword “future” 🤣
1443,♥️🖤🚀🎶👻🐇🧚‍♀️💫
1444,😃  …
1445,Will do another rev before final design
1446,I was
1447,That’s what I had in mind
1448,Sometimes even I think we’re the same person!
1449,"Nanotech *is* bs imo. When you take something that has nothing to do w gender & make it about that, you devalue genuine gender issues."
1450,"About to ship. @BoringCompany holding flamethrower pickup parties in a week or so, then deliveries begin. Check   … for details."
1451,It’s not
1452,That’s a great song!
1453,"Sometimes … when I have hurt feelings, I play this song …  …"
1454,"No, that’s the other guy @BoredElonMusk"
1455,So true 😢
1456,Because Twitter is fun
1457,USAToday FTW!
1458,Dank is wack unless you’re on weed
1459,"Exactly. And NYT could have anyone post an Op Ed. Why, of all people, are they choosing to publish this “non-journalist” who is also pro gasoline cars? Is this just published as counterpoint? I assume NYT does believe in climate change?"
1460,But femtotech is the future …   …
1461,Nanotech is so 2008. Picotech is 1000 times better.
1462,"Yeah, that’s exactly right. But after suggesting public critique, I was stunned to see the level of contempt many in media have for their readers. This is way worse than I thought.  …"
1463,The arguments journos are using against the public are word for word the same arguments despots use against democracy
1464,Well said. NYT journo is outraged that “dumb” public wd dare critique him while attacking me for being sensitive to criticism. Uhh...  …
1465,A Tesla has a usable reserve of 5 to 15 miles range even after the battery reads “empty”. This will not hurt the pack.
1466,"Pretty good. TinTin A & B are both closing the link to ground w phased array at high bandwidth, low latency (25 ms). Good enough to play fast response video games."
1467,"It’s cool for kids & if used in a fun way, but if you called yourself a “rocket scientist” in aerospace, they would think you’re 🙃"
1468,I just sent a note to Tesla service to take care of your car right away & our HVAC engineering lead to fix root cause
1469,Does the psych ward know you smuggled in a mobile phone?
1470,The pain will end
1471,"Wow, amazing Tesla hypermile drive happening  …"
1472,Gwynne has been prez of SpaceX for 10 years & well-deserved  …
1473,"Stop trying to charm me. It won’t work. Ok, maybe a little 😊 Are you a real person or a bot?"
1474,"Using “rocket science” non-ironically in a bio is never a good sign, especially if you work on 🚀🔬"
1475,What are you talking about? You’re being incredibly rude & nonsensical.
1476,"Wow, haven’t watched that video in ages. When we made that, no one in the space industry thought it would actually happen."
1477,"Generally higher quality reporting, especially if not under pressure to publish fast. Consumer Reports is great (and often critical of Tesla). Heard good things about The Information too."
1478,Can’t believe someone leaked this schematic of the Tesla production system!!
1479,"We tried, but Singapore govt is not supportive of electric vehicles"
1480,Tesla will start extending the Supercharger network to South America around end of next year
1481,Prob end of next year
1482,"Good point, we will add that to the construction plan"
1483,"Global map of Tesla Superchargers, including those coming soon   "
1484,"Earth’s rotation is slowly, slowly, slowly getting slower"
1485,You’re making my point. It’s tragic that there’s a national nano day. I wish I didn’t know that.
1486,All four. Zone 3 throughput was solved a couple of weeks ago.
1487,Model 3 was designed for min engineering & tooling change for RHD. Note left/right symmetry. LHD for Europe & Asia first half of next year. RHD probably middle of next year.
1488,This is the new production line for battery module Zone 4. Will play a key role in getting from 3000/week to 6000/week for Model 3.
1489,I have never attacked science. Definitely attacked misleading journalism like yours though.
1490,"Pravda was incorporated a year ago. Also, Tesla factory safety has improved every year & is now better than industry avg. Misleading articles refer to Tesla being worse than avg in 2015 when we were just figuring things out."
1491,Worth a shot
1492,Of course! (Prav)Duh. It is named after the most pernicious propaganda machine in history specifically to highlight what we want to avoid. It’s called “satire” …
1493,"This is going to help journalism, not harm it. Please be so kind as to hold your fire until you actually see it."
1494,"Problem solved, was able to buy   ! Game on …"
1495,"I know, I know. Russia seriously didn’t correct me on this!"
1496,"Something needs to be done to reward consistent, high quality journalism. Some in media are absurdly indignant before even seeing the product. Odd …"
1497,"Turns out    is actually owned by Ukraine. For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me …"
1498,"For some reason, Russia didn’t bother to correct me …"
1499,"Tried to buy   , but Russia said no. Turns out they already use it."
1500,"Definitely did not. I’ve been through many press cycles & know full well same person praising me today will trash me tomorrow. Journos hound me constantly for interviews, but I do almost none these days. ♥️ Twitter as it allows me to bypass journo bs."
1501,I’ve just had it with sanctimonious journalists who appoint themselves protectors of the public interest & yet believe that same public is too stupid & immoral to assess their credibility. It’s amazing that you don’t understand how insufferably hypocritical that is. Wow.
1502,The Tesla facility is open plan & we’re not going to erect walls everywhere for a journo tour. I know journalists too well & they are some of the worst & best human beings I’ve ever met. You’re the former.
1503,No
1504,Nano applies to everything & therefore means nothing. Definitely indicates bs. Sorry.  …
1505,"Yes, because Tesla has the most advanced battery manufacturing technology in the world & products that haven’t been unveiled yet. You don’t have a right to show that to our competitors or spoil future product launches."
1506,"Wow, you’re ignorant. Don’t remember you, but disclosing classified US missile technology to hostile nations would violate ITAR law & land you in jail. I didn’t review it, but my team did. Obviously nobody cared about what your article said. Please."
1507,Done
1508,Have a confirmed real name identity section & an unconfirmed identity section. Latter with subscore that excludes probable botnets.
1509,Be careful what you wish for  …
1510,"Amazingly, the “media is awesome” vote is declining, despite hundreds of articles attacking this very poll🤔"
1511,My point exactly  …
1512,"Ahem, you have “nano” in your bio. That is 100% synonymous with bs."
1513,Reddit is great
1514,"Come on media, you can do it! Get more people to vote for you. You are literally the media."
1515,Exactly. The point of such a site would be to help restore the credibility of the media. They don’t realize how little credibility they actually have with the public.
1516,"Why are certain journalists (editors especially) so concerned about the public rating their credibility? All they do all day is rate others, ostensibly on behalf of the same public for which they have contempt."
1517,I did to any who asked
1518,"That was obvious from a mile away. I tried to use their product & it didn’t work. Not exactly a genius move by WSJ, but they were brave enough to say it."
1519,"Maybe after you get your Model 3, we can talk about what you like & what needs to be improved"
1520,"But consider it real. We could unveil Model Y anytime from late this year to mid next year, so March 15 is about right."
1521,"I just made that up, because the Ides of March sounded good"
1522,Gasoline or diesel?
1523,What car do you drive?
1524,March 15
1525,The media
1526,"Hi Kara! I’m open to it. Right now, I’m cranking super hard at the Tesla factory, so it depends on how things are going next week."
1527,"Maybe the media credibility rating site should be called “You’re Right!”  I do actually own   , but for the moment I just have it automatically forward to Facebook News."
1528,Definitely
1529,"There no good car emojis. I mean seriously, what the heck are these 🚗 🚙 and this is the best one 🚘"
1530,Yo
1531,That’s the basic idea
1532,"For some reason, this is the best I’ve felt in a while. Hope you’re feeling good too 🚀♥️🌏"
1533,"I just tried to donate, but you don’t accept PayPal. Lmk when you do."
1534,"Um, you just tweeted about this, so obv you do"
1535,Thank you! I thought it was so obvious …
1536,Exactly. UAW does not have individual stock ownership as part of the compensation at any other company.
1537,"Yeah, I think you do great work"
1538,"If you’re in media & don’t want Pravda to exist, write an article telling your readers to vote against it …"
1539,🤗
1540,"I’ve never stopped a union vote nor removed a union. UAW abandoned this factory. Tesla arrived & gave people back their jobs. They haven’t forgotten UAW betrayed them. That’s why UAW can’t even get people to attend a free BBQ, let alone enough sigs for a vote."
1541,Of course
1542,"It is strange that big auto companies literally have thousands more factory injuries than Tesla & millions more auto deaths, but somehow get less coverage. We are not perfect, but we’re doing our best to make clean energy real & be a good company."
1543,"No, they’re just some rich kids in Berkeley who took their political science prof too seriously"
1544,Will do
1545,Create a media credibility rating site (that also flags propaganda botnets)
1546,That’s why editors are included too
1547,We don’t. The media is reporting someone else saying that Tesla advertised. It is untrue.
1548,"Even if some of the public doesn’t care about the credibility score, the journalists, editors & publications will. It is how they define themselves."
1549,Enough of the public does care about the truth. I have faith in the people.
1550,Maybe some good people from those orgs who would join
1551,"Not only needs to be botproof, but seek & unmask anyone operating a disinformation bot army"
1552,Exactly
1553,"Going to create a site where the public can rate the core truth of any article & track the credibility score over time of each journalist, editor & publication. Thinking of calling it Pravda …"
1554,An exception that proves the rule
1555,"Uh, this is Twitter. How many characters do you want?"
1556,"Problem is journos are under constant pressure to get max clicks & earn advertising dollars or get fired. Tricky situation, as Tesla doesn’t advertise, but fossil fuel companies & gas/diesel car companies are among world’s biggest advertisers."
1557,The media has earned this mistrust. But maybe there is a solution.
1558,Oh hey another sanctimonious media person who thinks he’s above criticism. Try being truthful & the public will believe you again.
1559,"Thought you’d say that. Anytime anyone criticizes the media, the media shrieks “You’re just like Trump!” Why do you think he got elected in the first place? Because no ones believes you any more. You lost your credibility a long time ago."
1560,"The holier-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth, but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie, is why the public no longer respects them  …"
1561,"This will sound super obvious, but Genesis & Oblivion"
1562,I am not cool
1563,The one about to come out called So Heavy i fell through the earth
1564,"Was sad to see G getting tons of undeserved flak because of me, so I’m glad there’s some good too ♥️🎼🐇. Her music is incredible."
1565,Thanks. Not super fun right now 😔
1566,Busted 👻
1567,"None of those criteria are certain by themselves, but when taken together & messages have an obv agenda, it almost always indicates use of a network of self-validating troll accounts"
1568,"Troll dead giveaways: not using real names, obv fake pics & backgrounds, low follower/follow ratio, account recently created, repeating same phrases, etc (sigh)"
1569,Great idea!
1570,Will do it later this year. Too much on plate right now. Will be available as an upgrade from service.
1571,Love original Deus Ex! That would be awesome.
1572,Interesting he stops at ‘09. That’s when you drove GM & Chrysler into bankruptcy & lost tens of thousands of jobs for people that counted on you.
1573,Just order your car with the James Bond option package. It’s an off-menu item for those in the know 😉
1574,"But ya know what, let’s test that theory. Maybe we do want UAW back, even tho UAW betrayed us 8 years ago & left us here to rot. Maybe we want UAW back even tho injury rate today is 1/2 what it was with them & wages were lower. Maybe. Let’s hold a vote & find out."
1575,"In theory true, but not how UAW behaved. They drove GM & Chrysler to bankruptcy & lost 200,000+ jobs for people they were supposed to protect, incl abandoning NUMMI plant workers.Tesla took over & now it has 10k+ jobs.UAW destroyed once great US auto industry & everyone knows it."
1576,"We’re going to include some fun games as hidden Easter eggs in Tesla S, X & 3. What do you think would be most fun in a car using the center touch screen?"
1577,Good point
1578,"No, UAW does that. They want divisiveness & enforcement of 2 class “lords & commoners” system. That sucks. US fought War of Independence to get *rid* of a 2 class system! Managers & workers shd be equal w easy movement either way. Managing sucks btw. Hate doing it so much."
1579,"More “Reveal” bs. Tesla is overseen by Cal/OSHA, most stringent labor safety org in US, & they’ve never found us to misrepresent. On other hand, Ford, Chrysler & GM (UAW) have repeatedly been found to fake safety numbers. Strangely, that info is missing from Reveal article …"
1580,No problem
1581,"They are incorrect. We never met, nor have we ever been scheduled to meet."
1582,"Thanks again, have conveyed your words to the Tesla team, who have been working crazy hard. Really energizing!"
1583,I didn’t meet with him
1584,I definitely don’t do this 5 minute thing. Need to have long uninterrupted times to think. Can’t be creative otherwise.
1585,Just wanted to say thanks to all Tesla supporters. I damn well love you.
1586,"Have been meaning to get around to talking to him. Some of his criticisms are valid, but, on the higher body/chassis weight front, he wasn’t fully appreciating that we were going for much higher crash safety levels than other cars."
1587,"Thanks Ryan. Critical feedback after you get the car would be much appreciated, no matter how nuanced."
1588,"To be clear, all Model 3 cars, incl early production will have same great braking ability. Nature of any product, however, is that if you care about perfection, you make constant small refinements. Today’s Model S is far more refined than initial production."
1589,ABS calibration algorithm
1590,"Also, Consumer Reports has an early production car. Model 3 now has improved ride comfort, lower wind noise & many other small improvements. Will request that they test current production."
1591,"Looks like this can be fixed with a firmware update. Will be rolling that out in a few days. With further refinement, we can improve braking distance beyond initial specs. Tesla won’t stop until Model 3 has better braking than any remotely comparable car."
1592,"Stop, you’re making me blush ☺️"
1593,"Also, not promising anything, but we *might* be able to increase Model 3 Performance power output a little"
1594,Complexity is the devil. Words can’t express how hard we are working on the Model 3 production ramp & trying to get to profitability. But we’ll try.
1595,"Good point. Yeah, we will do that for the bigger locations."
1596,"The CR braking result is inconsistent with other reviewers, but might indicate that some Model 3’s have longer braking distances than others. If so, we will address this at our expense. First time we’ve seen anything like this."
1597,"Even if a physical upgrade is needed to existing fleet, we will make sure all Model 3’s having amazing braking ability at no expense to customers"
1598,"Very strange. Model 3 is designed to have super good stopping distance & others reviewers have confirmed this. If there is vehicle variability, we will figure it out & address. May just be a question of firmware tuning, in which case can be solved by an OTA software update."
1599,"Cool, we can do the interview at Tesla in front of the yellow barriers & beeping forklifts you said didn’t exist. Please send your meeting request to wakassliar@tesla.com."
1600,Gwynne’s awesome. Been SpaceX prez for 10 years. Super love working with her.
1601,♥️🦄
1602,"Also, UAW did nada for job security in last recession. Dropped Fremont like a hot potato to protect their core base in Detroit. UAW *chose* to exit this plant before Tesla even arrived. We had nothing to do with UAW leaving, but everything to do with why people here have jobs."
1603,Nothing stopping Tesla team at our car plant from voting union. Could do so tmrw if they wanted. But why pay union dues & give up stock options for nothing? Our safety record is 2X better than when plant was UAW & everybody already gets healthcare.
1604,"Tesla factory literally has miles of painted yellow lines & tape. Report about forklifts not beeping is also bs. These are both demonstrably false, but were reported as “facts” by Reveal."
1605,We’re working on allowing you to use your phone in car when you hear a rattle/squeak & pinpoint origin by acoustic signature & triangulation
1606,SpaceX Crew Dragon ship in anechoic chamber for EMI testing before being sent to @NASA Plum Brook vacuum chamber
1607,For sure before snowfall this year
1608,It can tow far more than rated capacity
1609,Exactly! Will probably unveil next gen Supercharger late summer. Major improvements all round.
1610,"With production, 1st you need achieve target rate & then smooth out flow to achieve target cost. Shipping min cost Model 3 right away wd cause Tesla to lose money & die. Need 3 to 6 months after 5k/wk to ship $35k Tesla & live."
1611,That means nothing. Literally your Mom could file for NLRB.
1612,Exactly 🚀💫🎉! That will be really fun & shed light on what’s happening. Hoping to start that later this year after we become profitable. Difficult to justify before then.
1613,"Yeah, “Reveal” was carefully constructed propaganda with a name that wd make Orwell proud. Workplace injury rate of our factory when it was UAW w Toyota/GM was twice as high as today’s non-union."
1614,"About 2% of Tesla, incl salaried & hourly, union & non-union were let go in annual review. Only known union person fired was a guy who repeatedly threatened non-union supporters verbally & on social media & lied about it."
1615,Yes
1616,Exactly
1617,They can form a union whenever they want & there’s nothing I can do to stop them. California is a very pro-union state. They just don’t want to.
1618,Upgrade to the latest S. Nothing will give you greater joy. It’s like being able to have dopamine jacked straight into your brain at will.
1619,"They are correct. It’s awesome. Second best driving feel of any car in the world imo, apart from Model S. Traction control precision is super tight."
1620,"It does so constantly, but so smoothly that you can’t tell"
1621,Depends on when you placed your initial reservation. We start delivering the dual motor Model 3 in July.
1622,"Three or four months, depending on demand level. We have enough for about 1000/week right now."
1623,Good idea ...
1624,That is true. Electric motors are far more reliable than combustion engines. You need an electric motor just to start a gas engine!
1625,Tesla dual motor means there is a motor in front & a motor in rear. One is optimized for power & one for range. Car drives fine even if a motor breaks down. Helps ensure you make it to your destination & don’t get stuck on side of road in potentially unsafe conditions.
1626,Cost of normal dual motor AWD option is $5k. Range is also 310 miles. Takes 0-60mph to 4.5 sec & top speed to 140 mph.
1627,Black & white interior available only for Model 3 Performance initially due to limited parts availability. Will broaden over time.
1628,"Tesla AWD is dual motor, so you can fully drive the car even if one breaks"
1629,"Cost of all options, wheels, paint, etc  is included (apart from Autopilot). Cost is $78k. About same as BMW M3, but 15% quicker & with better handling. Will beat anything in its class on the track."
1630,"Tesla dual motor, all-wheel drive performance Model 3: 3.5 sec  0-60mph  155 mph Top Speed 310 mile Range"
1631,"It’s only slightly more expensive to Tesla (same price to car owners), but owner happiness is way higher, so worth doing"
1632,Exactly
1633,Will soon enable Tesla owners to request service from their phone with a few taps. Tesla Ranger will come to you to take care of your car. No need to bring the car in yourself & zero paperwork.
1634,I’m about to test the configurator & then it goes out to early reservation holders tonight
1635,"You can tweet to Tesla, me and/or get something upvoted in message boards"
1636,That is the way to go. Thanks for buying our cars!
1637,"Also, carbon fiber spoiler, 20” Performance wheels, black & white interior."
1638,"AC induction front & switched reluctance, partial permanent magnet rear. Silicon Carbide inverters in both. Performance drive units are lot sorted for highest sigma output & get double the burn-in."
1639,Working on Model 3 dual motor all-wheel drive & performance versions. Driving feel is amazing. Aiming to release config late tonight.
1640,Check out   . Build-your-own life size Egyptian pantheon merch coming soon.
1641,But The Boring Company is right behind you at 1/15th your speed & soon will be 1/10th! Start sweating …
1642,He taunts us with his speed
1643,Just … an ordinary snail
1644,His name is Gary & he’s a snail
1645,🐌
1646,Skip forward to see the most boring presentation ever  …
1647,Excited for @boringcompany partnership with LA Metro  …
1648,lol   …
1649,Listening to REALiTi
1650,"Yeah, there are thousands of Supercharger locations going through permitting/construction, including that area. Will publish an updated map in the next few days."
1651,Yes
1652,Will be presenting & taking questions  about The Boring Company plans for Los Angeles at 7pm on Thursday
1653,Boring Company Hyperloop will take you from city center under ground & ocean to spaceport in 10 to 15 mins  …
1654,"Time will tell, but so far it appears so"
1655,"It certainly needs to be better & we work to improve it every day, but perfect is enemy of good. A system that, on balance, saves lives & reduces injuries should be released."
1656,What’s actually amazing about this accident is that a Model S hit a fire truck at 60mph and the driver only broke an ankle. An impact at that speed usually results in severe injury or death.
1657,"It’s super messed up that a Tesla crash resulting in a broken ankle is front page news and the ~40,000 people who died in US auto accidents alone in past year get almost no coverage   …"
1658,Yes
1659,"According to NHTSA, there was an automotive fatality every 86M miles in 2017 (~40,000 deaths). Tesla was every 320M miles. It’s not possible to be zero, but probability of fatality is much lower in a Tesla. We will be reporting updated safety numbers after each quarter."
1660,"This is false. Eyetracking rejected for being ineffective, not for cost. WSJ fails to mention that Tesla is safest car on road, which would make article ridiculous. Approx 4X better than avg."
1661,Happy Mother’s Day Mom! Love you so much.
1662,"Fair criticism, but we’re fixing it fast. Hackathon going on right now to fix 2 worst robot production chokepoints. Looks promising."
1663,Lovely story  …
1664,"If someone is trying to control us through complicated sky patterns, they must really care. I would gladly obey their instructions, but I can’t figure them out."
1665,"SpaceX will prob build 30 to 40 rocket cores for ~300 missions over 5 years. Then BFR takes over & Falcon retires. Goal of BFR is to enable anyone to move to moon, Mars & eventually outer planets."
1666,Good piece by Ars  …
1667,Rate at which things are getting more bizarre appears to be increasing
1668,"Exactly. Gasoline cars will be like steam engines — quaint, but not something you’d actually use to get around. Btw, I like steam engines & trains in general."
1669,"Yeah, I heard this so many times. In the future, it will seem bizarre that we used to crash rockets into the ocean instead of reusing them."
1670,Yo
1671,Will make that a setting
1672,"Fossil fuels subsidized at $10 million a minute, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week  …"
1673,No use arguing with chimp. You’re blocked.
1674,"That article was pushed as propaganda to counter IMF study showing fossil fuel subsidies to be $5 trillion/year. Even if $4.9B was true, combined market cap of Tesla & SpaceX is $80B. Where did the other $75B come from? Ass 🎩 …"
1675,I have publicly asked people (like you) not to invest. Go fund Ford or whatever  …
1676,Launching in ~4 mins  …
1677,"AWD & white interior in July. Air suspension prob later. Note, that’s when we *start* making them. Can’t instantly fill all orders. Will take 6+ months to do so."
1678,"Our giant auto co competitors have much greater access to incentives than Tesla, which means Tesla has prospered in spite of govt subsidies, not because of them. Tesla mkt cap has *risen* over time as EV incentives declined. How strange …"
1679,"I love it too, but trying to keep config simple so as not to blow up the production ramp"
1680,Tesla will enable orders end of next week for dual motor AWD & performance. Starting production of those in July. Air suspension prob next year.
1681,A cool thing about the design is that’s easy to incorporate branch loops to serve small to mid size cities without slowing down the main loop at all
1682,Already started DC to NY route.  Hopefully start LA to SF next year. That will be true @Hyperloop w pressurized pods in near vacuum tunnels & faster than jetliner.
1683,First Boring Company tunnel under LA almost done! Pending final…   …
1684,"Towards end of next year. Btw, planning to launch Tesla in Turkey later this year. Love your country & will be there in person for the launch."
1685,"This will work on entire S & X fleet, even first production units. Cool thing about software upgrades is that we can keep making your car better long after you bought it."
1686,"All X & S will soon work with no key if your phone pairs w Bluetooth, signal strength is high & you enable feature"
1687,"Yeah, we will add that as a feature"
1688,!! Unnecessary characters. Will change.
1689,I wrote that masterpiece myself in HTML 1.0
1690,"Wow, thanks for the couch! I will match the donation from my foundation."
1691,My a capella cover of Amish Paradise is irresistible  …
1692,Tesla quarterly all-hands video. Love the shot of wild horses & Giga in winter  …
1693,So rococo
1694,Definitely not a logo of any kind
1695,Stole it
1696,We sketched concept together & worked w a trusted team to make it
1697,Glass corset hand-painted in perspective in color of bone. Every detail tells a story. Spiked choker machined from a single piece of forged metal. Crown of Vantablack.
1698,Hi Danielle!
1699,"Don’t want to blow your mind, but I’m pretty weird. It’s time the world knew."
1700,Night at the museum. G has mad skillzsz. Me not so much.   
1701,Literally every word is untrue
1702,"That’s a white rose on my jacket & the choker is a bunch of spikes, not Tesla anything"
1703,This chart shows how crazy low payout is to labels & the artists only a small fraction of these numbers
1704,"Prob iTunes, but whatever works 4u is fine. Most people don’t buy music & artist earnings from streaming are tiny. Mostly about touring.  …"
1705,Flesh without Blood & Kill V Maim on Art Angels album  …
1706,Love Powerglide too  …
1707,Yes
1708,  
1709,  
1710,Rococo basilisk
1711,The Boring Company will be using dirt from tunnel digging to create bricks for low cost housing
1712,"(Sigh) I do like Ty, but she’s a friend. We are not dating."
1713,Saying you like “moats” is just a nice way of saying you like oligopolies
1714,Warren Buffett is huge in candy. It’s actually true.  …
1715,I’m killin me lol
1716,lol
1717,Hi Sarah
1718,Then I’m going to build a moat & fill it w candy. Warren B will not be able to resist investing! Berkshire Hathaway kryptonite …
1719,Cryptocandy
1720,"Ok ok, just for sake of argument, what do u wish for in candy? 🍭"
1721,What do you think we’re living in?
1722,It just occurred to me that the plot of Willy Wonka is really messed up
1723,I am super super serious
1724,I’m starting a candy company & it’s going to be amazing
1725,  …  …
1726,This will be bigger
1727,I try so hard to help them …
1728,Thanks for letting me know. Will expedite. Sorry for the delay.
1729,"Looks like sooner than expected. The sheer magnitude of short carnage will be unreal. If you’re short, I suggest tiptoeing quietly to the exit …  …"
1730,New Roadster will have that
1731,"Yes, definitely not"
1732,It will be next level. These are really big numbers.
1733,Oh and uh short burn of the century comin soon. Flamethrowers should arrive just in time.
1734,Yup
1735,"True. And once they were on the call, I should have answered their questions live. It was foolish of me to ignore them."
1736,"We went through the same drama on S & X and almost all confirmed in the end. Will likely be even better for Model 3, as customer satisfaction score post delivery is higher. I worry zero about demand. Just spent all night in the factory, not the showroom."
1737,"Reason RBC question about Model 3 demand is absurd is that Tesla has roughly half a million reservations, despite no advertising & no cars in showrooms. Even after reaching 5k/week production, it would take 2 years just to satisfy existing demand even if new sales dropped to 0."
1738,"The reason the Bernstein question about CapEx was boneheaded was that it had already been answered in the headline of the Q1 newsletter he received beforehand, along with details in the body of the letter"
1739,"The 2 questioners I ignored on the Q1 call are sell-side analysts who represent a short seller thesis, not investors"
1740,Exactly
1741,"First, it’s important to know that Tesla is the most shorted (meaning most bet against) stock on the market & has been for a while  …"
1742,Please ignore this thread unless you’re interested in a tedious discussion about Tesla stock
1743,They were neither valid nor pertinent. I will explain why on a primary Twitter thread.
1744,"Yeah, news is actually super good. Model S & X are producing major positive cash flow & Model 3 is about to do same."
1745,"To be clear, I’m a big fan of MKBHD, but this is an important clarification"
1746,"The “dry” questions were not asked by investors, but rather by two sell-side analysts who were trying to justify their Tesla short thesis. They are actually on the *opposite* side of investors. HyperChange represented actual investors, so I switched to them."
1747,You’re most welcome  …
1748,Your numbers are incorrect. Tesla Fremont is 3rd in world after a 🇳🇱🌸 place & 🇦🇪 mall. Giga will be largest when complete.
1749,Woke Frisbee   …
1750,La la la  …
1751,SpaceX Crew Dragon ships to the Cape in about 3 months
1752,🖤 Ars Technica 🖤
1753,Falcon 9 fairing opens its parafoil after reentering the atmosphere   …
1754,Ok
1755,That’s how I use my eyebrows too
1756,I have prehensile eyebrows
1757,😉
1758,"Yeah, most people don’t know this, but comets r mostly made of cocaine"
1759,Almost ready to test the new Boring Company / SpaceX hyperpod prototype. Exciting video guaranteed.
1760,  …   …
1761,Don’t make me use my space lasers …
1762,I know … such an underserved market
1763,Oh btw I’m building a cyborg dragon
1764,Sounds great riding my cyborg 🐉
1765,Likewise … was just listening to Go Flex & Psycho on @Grimezsz playlist
1766,Mostly not
1767,Tesla batteries are currently live & delivering power at 662 locations in Puerto Rico. Team is working 24/7 to activate several hundred more.  …
1768,Russia has great rocket technology & talent. Much respect. Would encourage focus on reusability. Single-use rockets cannot be competitive any more than single-use aircraft.
1769,Doing our best
1770,  …
1771,  …
1772,  …
1773,Now  …
1774,Driving a Model 3 and playing  …
1775,"Yeah, exactly! Would be great to hear your thoughts. We’re going to try a few approaches. Can def be done, just about minimizing mass."
1776,"We already do targeted retro burn to a specific point in Pacific w no islands or ships, so upper stage doesn’t become a dead satellite. Need to retarget closer to shore & position catcher ship like Mr Steven."
1777,And then land on a bouncy house
1778,"Yeah, but great for creating a giant object that retains its shape across all Mach regimes & drops ballistic coefficient by 2 orders of magnitude"
1779,SpaceX will try to bring rocket upper stage back from orbital velocity using a giant party balloon
1780,"This is gonna sound crazy, but …"
1781,Interview and Tesla factory tour with Gayle King  …
1782,Too wasted to remember
1783,"Don’t want to brag or anything, but that happens to me sometimes …"
1784,"Yes, excessive automation at Tesla was a mistake. To be precise, my mistake. Humans are underrated."
1785,"The Economist used to be boring, but smart with a wicked dry wit. Now it’s just boring (sigh). Tesla will be profitable & cash flow+ in Q3 & Q4, so obv no need to raise money."
1786,"Sorry, demand has been higher than expected. Making them as fast as possible, but waitlist is 3 to 6 months."
1787,Looking into it. This is bizarre.
1788,Maybe a little 😉
1789,Gwynne’s got it covered. She’s awesome.
1790,I love trolls
1791,Norway has some really cool tunnels and bridges
1792,Should be fully fixed within the next few days
1793,Place your bets …
1794,This is a very important action by China. Avoiding a trade war will benefit all countries.
1795,How many views?
1796,SpaceX main body tool for the BFR interplanetary spaceship   
1797,Free viewing ends in about 5 hours  …
1798,Definitely. Will take corrective action immediately. Sorry about this.
1799,Looking into it now
1800,Should just be due to your config not avail yet. If not lmk.
1801,Similar timing
1802,So probably July
1803,We need to achieve 5k/week with Model 3 before adding complexity that would inhibit production ramp
1804,"This is kinda nutty for such a short distance, so could easily end up being shredded metal, but exciting either way"
1805,Upgraded SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pod speed test soon. Will try to reach half speed of sound (and brake) within ~1.2km.
1806,Model 3 is the whole point. We only made the more expensive cars in order to make the mass-market car. We lacked the economies of scale and expertise to make it until now.
1807,The cat videos are awesome 🐱
1808,   at 5M views after 36 hours. Congrats to Chris Paine & co!
1809,Exactly
1810,"“You are my creator, but I am your master” — Mary Shelley"
1811,In memory of Stephen Hawking
1812,Nothing will affect the future of humanity more than digital super-intelligence. Watch Chris Paine’s new AI movie for free until Sunday night at   
1813,Chris Paine AI movie premiering tonight  …
1814,We will add a feature to allow request of latest software version
1815,This is false
1816,"Oh, it’s on …"
1817,Most people don’t know there’s a whole box of Easter eggs with every Tesla. Just tap logo on center screen & wait. Easy access to most of discovered ones. More coming …
1818,"Uhh, hello, I need to build cars"
1819,"About a year ago, I asked Doug to manage both engineering & production. He agreed that Tesla needed eng & prod better aligned, so we don’t design cars that are crazy hard to build. Right now, tho, better to divide & conquer, so I’m back to sleeping at factory. Car biz is hell …"
1820,"Can’t believe you’re even writing about this. My job as CEO is to focus on what’s most critical, which is currently Model 3 production. Doug, who I regard as one of the world’s most talented engineering execs, is focused on vehicle engineering."
1821,"We release as soon as we have the data. Good timeline, bad timing. Doesn’t matter."
1822,"Not criticizing, just as asking questions. I’m sure there’s a really great answer …"
1823,"Tesla policy is to issue a recall *before* there are injuries. This is absolutely the right thing to do. Yet there were dozens of recalls by other car companies last month, incl w injuries & deaths, but you only wrote an article about Tesla. Why so?"
1824,"Seriously! Obviously, I’m not going to do an April Fool’s joke about going bankwupt if I thought there was any chance it would actually happen (sigh)."
1825,"Lot of respect for NTSB, but NHTSA regulates cars, not NTSB, which is an advisory body. Tesla releases critical crash data affecting public safety immediately & always will. To do otherwise would be unsafe."
1826,"Oh yeah, forgot to mention it actually landed fine, just not on Mr Steven "
1827,What about this?  …
1828,Elon University is a real place
1829,Coming soon to Tesla merch. Free shots in stores every April 1st.
1830,As you wish
1831,It’s the best
1832,"Elon was found passed out against a Tesla Model 3, surrounded by ""Teslaquilla"" bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks.   This is not a forward-looking statement, because, obviously, what's the point?  Happy New Month! "
1833,"There are many chapters of bankruptcy and, as critics so rightly pointed out, Tesla has them *all*, including Chapter 14 and a half (the worst one)."
1834,"Tesla Goes Bankrupt Palo Alto, California, April 1, 2018 -- Despite intense efforts to raise money, including a last-ditch mass sale of Easter Eggs, we are sad to report that Tesla has gone completely and totally bankrupt. So bankrupt, you can't believe it."
1835,Important news in a few hours …
1836,Love seeing the scars of the rocket
1837,"Hopefully, actual video coming soon. Aiming to improve the link quality so it can be real-time."
1838,Everything’s better with fire

1841,"GPS guided parafoil twisted, so fairing impacted water at high speed. Air wake from fairing messing w parafoil steering. Doing helo drop tests in next few weeks to solve."
1842,Mr Steven is 5 mins away from being under the falling fairing (don’t have live video)
1843,"Attempting recovery of fairing falling down from space (right now) with our boat, Mr Steven. It’s a giant steel & webbing catcher’s mitt superstructure on a high-speed ocean ship. Godspeed, Mr. S …"
1844,"House party for the autonomous anarcho-syndicalist commune!! —— Peasant Woman: Well, how'd you…   "
1845,Yes. I forgot my sword.
1846,Dueling Dwarf Vader while dressed as a knight and using a parasol for a sword
1847,"Turns out joking about being a “rock” star because of digging tunnels (through, uh, rock — hello??) is deeply underappreciated"
1848,"Yes, you can upgrade hardware, although we also wrote software to accelerate rendering on old MCU. Coming out soon & makes a big diff."
1849,"From my Mom: every time I use irony, I lose a friend"
1850,And they said I’d never be a rock star …
1851,Yes
1852,"Uhh, it’s literally made of rock"
1853,"Yeah, the boring bricks are interlocking with a precise surface finish, so two people could build the outer walls of a small house in a day or so"

1857,"New Boring Company merch coming soon. Lifesize LEGO-like interlocking bricks made from tunneling rock that you can use to create sculptures & buildings. Rated for California seismic loads, so super strong, but bored in the middle, like an aircraft wing spar, so not heavy."
1858,"New nav starts rolling out this weekend. Should be considered a mature beta at first, so won’t be perfect, but will improve rapidly. With the old system, we were stuck with legacy 3rd party black box code and stale data. No way to improve."
1859,Shocker
1860,It’s not a political statement and I didn’t do this because someone dared me to do it. Just don’t like Facebook. Gives me the willies. Sorry.
1861,I have just asked our team to slow down deliveries. It is clear that we are exceeding the local logistics capacity due to batch build and delivery. Customer happiness & safety matter more than a few extra cars this quarter.
1862,You’ll live
1863,We’ve never advertised with FB. None of my companies buy advertising or pay famous people to fake endorse. Product lives or dies on its own merits.
1864,"Instagram’s probably ok imo, so long as it stays fairly independent. I don’t use FB & never have, so don’t think I’m some kind of martyr or my companies are taking a huge blow. Also, we don’t advertise or pay for endorsements, so … don’t care."
1865,Ok
1866,"What, a troll, me!? How dare you, sir!"
1867,"Yeah, my fault for being an idiot. We did give them a free launch to make up for it and I think they had some insurance."
1868,Definitely. Looks lame anyway.
1869,First time I’ve seen either. One on the left looks official. Will be gone soon.
1870,Maybe that word doesn’t mean what I think it does
1871,Literally never seen it even once
1872,"Yeah, it’s borderline. FB influence is slowly creeping in."
1873,I didn’t realize there was one. Will do.
1874,Inconceivable! Who’d say a thing like that!?
1875,What’s Facebook?
1876,"Wow, a whole week. Risky ..."
1877,Umm...yes
1878,Yes
1879,I double-dare them to come back! Bring it ...
1880,No technology is too advanced for The Boring Company!   
1881,"That said, Lori deserves a lot of credit for supporting competitive, commercial space launch while under massive assault from old-school monopolists"
1882,"No real surface is perfect, but it did pull about 250,000 lbs of muck rail cars out of a tunnel "
1883,"Probably mid next year before we are able to make RHD. Wish it could be sooner. Maybe try a Model S, used or new in the meantime? Used S is better than a new 3 imo, unless you want a smaller car."
1884,Sorry 🤗
1885,"Model X pulls a 95,000 lb (15,000 above US road legal limit) semi truck on a pure snow surface  …"
1886,Thanks!
1887,Sounds like this canton has style!
1888,Ok
1889,You’re welcome. Sorry for the delay. Only just got back from Gigafactory. Will be at our Fremont factory in the morning. Tesla team is going all out.
1890,Better to be in the Model X  …
1891,"The Swiss police are smart. Electricity vs diesel & maintenance more than make up for purchase price diff. Plus, the bad guys will def not escape. That’s worth a lot …  …"
1892,Maybe there should be 2 providers for Chicago advanced transit. Monopolies are so boring ...  …
1893,Petra and Mars   
1894,"Lori, this is ridiculous. Creating a rocket company has to be one of the dumbest and hardest ways to “make money”. If it was about money, I’d just do another Internet company."
1895,This is completely false. Never even heard of Cortica. Just taking my kids on a Spring Break trip to see ancient historical sites in Israel & Jordan.
1896,Paid respects to Masada earlier today. Live free or die.   
1897,Learning how to pour flaming absinthe over a tower of glasses in a Jerusalem speakeasy.…   
1898,Thanks for your support over all those years!
1899,"Your cruel taunts cut me deep. Deep. But, I love you too."
1900,Oh you guys ...
1901,Yeah. I find it soothing.
1902,Yes
1903,Good point
1904,"That’s the name of my new intergalactic media empire, exclamation point optional"
1905,Resist
1906,Thinkularity
1907,Thud!
1908,Great idea!
1909,"My brother, Jonah and I are going to do a cover of My Little Buttercup from The Three Amigos. It will be terrible. There will also be a plethora of Q and sometimes even A.  …"
1910,On the Westworld set with my bro @kimbal   
1911,"Why Falcon Heavy & Starman?  Life cannot just be about solving one sad problem after another. There need to be things that inspire you, that make you glad to wake up in the morning and be part of humanity. That is why we did it. We did for you.  …"
1912,Doesn’t make any sense. You can’t “take things that fail” & make them work without creativity & invention.
1913,"No, it’s not"
1914,None of the above
1915,Tunnels
1916,Because blue
1917,"I guess you could say it’s a 150 mph, underground, autonomous, electric bus that automatically switches between tunnels and lifts. So, yes, a bus."
1918,"Better video coming soon, but it would look a bit like this: "
1919,"Boring Co urban loop system would have 1000’s of small stations the size of a single parking space that take you very close to your destination & blend seamlessly into the fabric of a city, rather than a small number of big stations like a subway"
1920,Definitely
1921,"Will still transport cars, but only after all personalized mass transit needs are met. It’s a matter of courtesy & fairness. If someone can’t afford a car, they should go first."
1922,Adjusting The Boring Company plan: all tunnels & Hyperloop will prioritize pedestrians & cyclists over cars
1923,Heavy sigh
1924,"Talulah is in England, finishing her second novel. It’s about a future matriarchal society, with a twist."
1925,"Will be at SXSW Sat/Sun with Jonah & Lisa, who created Westworld. Jonah made an incredible short reel of Falcon Heavy & Starman. Releases tmrw aft."
1926,"To be clear, I think a fair outcome for all is quite likely. China has already shown a willingness to open their markets and I believe they will do the right thing."
1927,"We raised this with the prior administration and nothing happened. Just want a fair outcome, ideally where tariffs/rules are equally moderate. Nothing more. Hope this does not seem unreasonable."
1928,"I am against import duties in general, but the current rules make things very difficult. It’s like competing in an Olympic race wearing lead shoes."
1929,"Also, no US auto company is allowed to own even 50% of their own factory in China, but there are five 100% China-owned EV auto companies in the US"
1930,"For example, an American car going to China pays 25% import duty, but a  Chinese car coming to the US only pays 2.5%, a tenfold difference"
1931,"Do you think the US & China should have equal & fair rules for cars? Meaning, same import duties, ownership constraints & other factors."
1932,"Every time Alexa laughs, an angel dies, so thank goodness …"
1933,Depends on what you mean by “doom”
1934,"First production cargo trip of the Tesla Semi heavy duty truck, carrying battery packs from the…   "
1935,Will have Model X do a cover of Happy Birthday by Marilyn Monroe  …
1936,"Literally, if you type “jazz hands”, iOS shows this emoji 🤗"
1937,I just realized there is a jazz hands emoji 🤗
1938,"If there is anyone in the third row, turn off air recirculation. Third row cooling happens by air entering from the front and exiting through the vents in the rear bumper."
1939,"Very proud of the SpaceX team! Can’t believe it’s been fifty Falcon 9 launches already. Just ten years ago, we couldn’t even reach orbit with little Falcon 1."
1940,"Falcon 9 flight 50 launches tonight, carrying Hispasat for Spain. At 6 metric tons and almost the size of a city bus, it will be the largest geostationary satellite we’ve ever flown."
1941,"Very sensible summary of supersonic flight. Obvious answer is to fly high, which gives low drag & low boom amplitude at ground. If boom too loud, airframe design probably wrong too."
1942,Good points. Will add to feature list.
1943,"Yeah, that should improve soon. Software team has been buried in Model 3 bringup and tricky bug fixes, but that’s mostly done now."
1944,Almost done
1945,"Deep in the hole with my boring machine. Sometimes when we touch, the honesty’s too much ...   "
1946,Probably about a tenth of the cost and a fifth of the time
1947,"Want to clarify that as individuals, the people responsible for the high costs & long timelines are almost all well-meaning, but the system of incentives is messed up"
1948,"Higher safety & environmental requirements & labor costs explain only a small part of the difference. True root cause imo is an exponential growth in bureaucracy & a self-serving private sector consultant industry earning a % on project cost, incenting them to maximize cost."
1949,And New York   …
1950,And we are even worse than that in California  …
1951,China’s progress in advanced infrastructure is more than 100 times faster than the US  …
1952,"Wow, if even Pinker doesn’t understand the difference between functional/narrow AI (eg. car) and general AI, when the latter *literally* has a million times more compute power and an open-ended utility function, humanity is in deep trouble"
1953,"End-to-end encryption encoded at firmware level. Unlikely to be hacked w current computing tech. If it is (and we learn about it), a crypto fix will go out immediately via network-wide firmware update."
1954,Will be simpler than IPv6 and have tiny packet overhead. Definitely peer-to-peer.
1955,Am feeling optimistic about beating the Semi specs announced at the unveiling for the same price. The Tesla Semi will be something really special.
1956,Can someone please do that!? I would def go.
1957,"That was a DM, right?"
1958,"Don’t tell anyone, but the wifi password is “martians”"
1959,Tintin A & B will attempt to beam “hello world” in about 22 hours when they pass near LA
1960,"First two Starlink demo satellites, called Tintin A & B, deployed and communicating to Earth stations "
1961,"Falcon fairing half as seen from our catcher’s mitt in boat form, Mr. Steven. No apparent damage…   "
1962,About a month
1963,"This was an older version booster, so no recovery attempted"
1964,"Missed by a few hundred meters, but fairing landed intact in water. Should be able catch it with slightly bigger chutes to slow down descent."
1965,Made it back from space and fairing parafoil just deployed. Now trying to catch it ...
1966,Going to try to catch the giant fairing (nosecone) of Falcon 9 as it falls back from space at…   
1967,"If you love drones above your house, you’ll really love vast numbers of “cars” flying over your head that are 1000 times bigger and noisier and blow away anything that isn’t nailed down when they land"
1968,"Not sure. I let @jack know, but it’s still going. I literally own zero cryptocurrency, apart from .25 BTC that a friend sent me many years ago."
1969,That’s just random
1970,"If anyone is curious, the name was inspired by The Fault in Our Stars"
1971,"High altitude wind shear data shows a probable 2% load exceedance. Small, but better to be paranoid. Postponing launch to tomorrow, assuming winds are better then."
1972,"Today’s Falcon launch carries 2 SpaceX test satellites for global broadband. If successful, Starlink constellation will serve least served."
1973,Strange though. Delta IV Heavy has half the payload of Falcon Heavy and the BO rocket doesn’t exist yet.
1974,I don’t get the little ship thing. You can’t show up at Mars in something the size of a rowboat. What if there are Martians? It would be so embarrassing.
1975,I’m sure it’s parked around here somewhere …   
1976,With Asimov’s Foundation Series etched in glass in the glovebox. Zeroth law …
1977,My new toaster   
1978,Adding software feature to open glovebox automatically when car comes to a stop after a crash. Will look at bonding a thin plastic sheet to the front or back of screen.
1979,Found the source of the problem. The NASA database has the Falcon Block 1 performance. Version currently in production and set to fly in a few months is Block 5. SpaceX GNC team is submitting updated numbers.
1980,Not enough ignition fluid to light the outer two engines after several three engine relights. Fix is pretty obvious.
1981,"East, to support high flight rates for F9 and dual ocean landings for FH side boosters"
1982,No
1983,A Shortfall of Gravitas
1984,A third is under construction
1985,"Under consideration. We’ve already stretched the upper stage once. Easiest part of the rocket to change. Fairing 2, flying soon, also has a slightly larger diameter. Could make fairing much longer if need be & will if BFR takes longer than expected."
1986,"Side boosters landing on droneships & center expended is only ~10% performance penalty vs fully expended. Cost is only slightly higher than an expended F9, so around $95M."
1987,  …
1988,Of course :)
1989,"Maybe that plan works out, but I will seriously eat my hat with a side of mustard if that rocket flies a national security spacecraft before 2023"
1990,"That was three years ago, before ULA cancelled all medium versions of Delta IV. Future missions have all Delta fixed costs piled on, so their cost is now $600M+ for missions contracted for launch after 2020. Nutty high."
1991,"Both exhaust velocity (Isp) and mass ratio drive the rocket equation. Also thrust/mass matters a lot for Oberth effect. Delta upper stage Isp is good, but mass ratio and thrust are not."
1992,"The performance numbers in this database are not accurate. In process of being fixed. Even if they were, a fully expendable Falcon Heavy, which far exceeds the performance of a Delta IV Heavy, is $150M, compared to over $400M for Delta IV Heavy."
1993,Love and Rockets   
1994,"Now, if I can just figure out how to attach those to a really big shark ..."
1995,Falcon Heavy engine plumes look like giant laser beams in this photo by rocketphotography   
1996,Last pic of Starman in Roadster on its journey to Mars orbit and then the Asteroid Belt   
1997,Third burn successful. Exceeded Mars orbit and kept going to the Asteroid Belt.
1998,Thank you on behalf of SpaceX. An exciting future lies ahead!

2023,Falcon Heavy launch simulation almost ready. Will be set to Bowie’s Life on Mars.
2024,Customs problem solved!
2025,Or maybe “Temperature Enhancement Device”
2026,"Apparently, some customs agencies are saying they won’t allow shipment of anything called a “Flamethrower”. To solve this, we are renaming it “Not a Flamethrower”."
2027,"Early access build and especially Dev build are feature-rich, but the features aren’t reliable enough yet"
2028,Release candidate in final testing phase
2029,No
2030,I think we’ve figured it out
2031,Yes
2032,"Small detail, but each one will come with a serial number from 1 to 20,000 "
2033,A snowthrower would be really fun
2034,All flamethrowers will ship with a complimentary boring fire extinguisher
2035,Flamethrowers sold out
2036,Of course
2037,Yes
2038,"This rocket was meant to test very high retrothrust landing in water so it didn’t hurt the droneship, but amazingly it has survived. We will try to tow it back to shore. "

2047,10k
2048,"For sure, and it keeps you warm at the same time"
2049,Coming soon
2050,Sure
2051,Sentience is overrated
2052,"But wait, there’s more: the flamethrower is sentient, its safe word is “cryptocurrency” and it comes with a free blockchain"
2053,Ok
2054,Hmm ... portal gun. Now that would be interesting.
2055,You’d need millions of zombies for a so-called “apocalypse” anyway. Where would I even get a factory big enough to make so many!?
2056,The rumor that I’m secretly creating a zombie apocalypse to generate demand for flamethrowers is completely false
2057,Good thing you didn’t ask about the Freezegun ...
2058,Hmmm
2059,Unless you like fun
2060,"Obviously, a flamethrower is a super terrible idea. Definitely don’t buy one."
2061,"1,000 ordered already, only 19,000 left!"
2062,"When the zombie apocalypse happens, you’ll be glad you bought a flamethrower. Works against hordes of the undead or your money back!"
2063,Don’t do this   
2064,ATF says any flamethrower with a flame shorter than 10 ft is A-ok. Our design is max fun for least danger. I’d be way more scared of a steak knife.
2065,Great for roasting nuts 🔥 🥜   
2066,The Boring Company flamethrower guaranteed to liven up any party!  
2067,Say hello to my little friend …   
2068,Aiming for first flight of Falcon Heavy on Feb 6 from Apollo launchpad 39A at Cape Kennedy. Easy viewing from the public causeway.
2069,Falcon Heavy hold-down firing this morning was good. Generated quite a thunderhead of steam. Launching in a week or so.
2070,Check    for updates
2071,Done
2072,"Definitely. You will be able to do pretty much anything via voice command. Software team is focused on core Model 3 functionality right now, but that will be done soon, then we will add a lot more features."
2073,There aren’t even good normal parties in Silicon Valley!
2074,"Actually, you can upgrade the battery pack for a huge improvement in range and some improvement in performance. There are other items you can upgrade too (seats, infotainment, etc), but I recommend keeping those parts original."
2075,That sounds cool. Will do.
2076,Fixed in next release
2077,"Long exposure of rocket ascent, reentry from space and landing burn. (Credit @johnkrausphotos)   "
2078,Good idea. We can just have the menu pop up as soon as you put the car into park.
2079,Of course. And an outdoor screen that plays a highlight reel of the best scenes in movie history.
2080,Near 405
2081,"Gonna put an old school drive-in, roller skates & rock restaurant at one of the new Tesla Supercharger locations in LA"
2082,Falcon Heavy goes vertical
2083,Using a neural net to detect rain using cameras (no dedicated rain or sun sensors). Computers are very patient.  …
2084,Come work at the biggest & most advanced factory on Earth! Located by a river near the beautiful Sierra Nevada mountains with wild horses roaming free.  …
2085,Coming very soon
2086,Vastly better maps/nav coming soon
2087,Ok
2088,Sure
2089,"Yeah, it’s terrible. Had to upgrade old Linux OS and a bunch of drivers first. Major browser upgrades coming to all cars in a few months. Note, will be slower at first until code is optimized."
2090,Similar total size. Maybe slightly bigger to account for a really gamechanging (I think) feature I’d like to add.
2091,"Sustainable energy production with solar and batteries will grow much faster than auto on a percentage basis. That will be a big focus next year, with primary remaining Model 3 ramp."
2092,"Was gonna say we’ll do all but the last, but that last one sounds like good, cheesy fun :)"
2093,Should be in next update
2094,Done
2095,I promise that we will make a pickup truck right after Model Y. Have had the core design/engineering elements in my mind for almost 5 years. Am dying to build it.
2096,"Sorry for the delay. We have the most advanced AI neural net of any consumer product by far, so it’s going through exhaustive testing. The results are blowing me away though and I think you will have a similar experience."
2097,"Wanted again to send a note of deep gratitude to Tesla owners WW for taking a chance on a new company that all experts said would fail.   So much blood, sweat & tears from the Tesla team went into creating cars that you’d truly love. I hope you do.  How can we improve further?"
2098,"We will! At least, whatever is left over after we build the obelisks."
2099,The circle is complete
2100,Ok
2101,"Hats sold out, flamethrowers soon!"
2102,It does often seem that the most entertaining belief or outcome is the most likely to prevail
2103,True
2104,"So strange that people often believe things inversely proportionate to the evidence. Given a set of possible explanations, why pick the extremely unlikely one!?"
2105,Yes
2106,Having a sinking feeling that most people actually do think it was aliens …
2107,"When you get the new Tesla software update, go Ho Ho Ho. There’s an Easter egg inside the Easter egg, but it’s not funny."
2108,"46k limited edition boring hats sold, 4K to go. Then flamethrower."
2109,I think last night might have been the biggest Rorschach test ever
2110,Isn’t it obvious?
2111,"If you liked tonight’s launch, you will really like Falcon Heavy next month: 3 rocket cores & 3X thrust. 2 cores return to base doing synchronized aerobatics. 3rd lands on droneship."
2112,Never heard of it  …
2113,Nuclear alien UFO from North Korea
2114,It was definitely aliens
2115,Launch underway  …
2116,"His “PhD” is in literature (really), presumably bad fiction"
2117,How much is it?
2118,I love Twitter
2119,"Bloody hell, I’m going to have to write a blog. Can’t fit this into tweets."
2120,I would only call someone an idiot if people were mistakenly under the impression that the person was smart
2121,"However, public transit is obviously not fully solving the problem, as most major cities have been in traffic hell for decades with no solution in sight. Multi-level tunnels can solve this, but we need much better tunneling technology, as it is currently super slow and expensive."
2122,"Major navigation overhaul coming in early 2018. Will be light-years ahead of current system, but we are testing it rigorously before rolling out."
2123,"For the record, I actually love trains, most subways and London buses."
2124,"Idiots can be very dangerous when they seem smart, but aren’t (having “PhD” in their bio is a dead giveaway), as some policymakers may get fooled. That’s what really bothered me about that human cat meme / transit “expert”."
2125,Glad to see that Tesla owners are having a good experience. Working to improve further. Some cool software updates coming soon.  …
2126,Sorry about that. Thanks for letting me know. Will get it fixed.
2127,Pics soon
2128,"With people around, so you can see scale "
2129,"If things go perfectly, all three rocket booster cores will come back and land. Sides back at the Cape, center on the droneship."
2130,Falcon Heavy launching from same @NASA pad as the Saturn V Apollo 11 moon rocket. It was 50% higher thrust with five F-1 engines at 7.5M lb-F. I love that rocket so much.
2131,Max thrust at lift-off is 5.1 million pounds or 2300 metric tons. First mission will run at 92%.
2132,Hate it when that happens. Some people are so rude!
2133,Falcon Heavy at the Cape
2134,Knight Rider is real
2135,Thanks!  …
2136,"For now, we only use those on super hot reentry missions. Will go to all Ti with Falcon 9 V5, which is a few months away."

2140,42k
2141,Meant to say “sanctimonious idiot”
2142,Good point. It’s just a really bad and fundamentally misleading article that doesn’t actually represent my point of view at all. Other publications referred to it as an “interview”.
2143,Sorry
2144,You’re an idiot
2145,"This depressingly misleading & misanthropic article came from a very brief digression at an AI conf, not from an interview with Wired as is falsely implied. This is why I stopped following Wired long ago. There are way better tech pubs out there."
2146,Yes
2147,"Yeah, pretty much anywhere"
2148,Yes

2163,Deal
2164,"That special hat delivery will take place deep within the real, but fictional (of course), tunnel we are building under LA while you drive the giant machine blindfolded. This will actually happen."
2165,Beyond anything you can imagine
2166,"And, at the risk of stating the obvious, extremely boring"

2174,That’s certainly the right way to go to store massive amounts of data for a long time
2175,Asimov’s Foundation books should def be part of the mission. They’re amazing.
2176,I love the thought of a car drifting apparently endlessly through space and perhaps being discovered by an alien race millions of years in the future
2177,Red car for a red planet
2178,Yeah

2205,"Not saying the next gen Roadster special upgrade package *will* definitely enable it to fly short hops, but maybe …   Certainly possible. Just a question of safety. Rocket tech applied to a car opens up revolutionary possibilities."
2206,Should clarify that this is the base model performance. There will be a special option package that takes it to the next level.

2250,That's just to win our Hyperloop student competition in ~1 mile tube. Practical version would have a turbo compressor on front taking ram air pressure at near sonic to hypersonic speeds & driving that thru air skiis & rearward for thrust.

2270,Answers: Yes. No. Doesn't matter.
2271,"There is only one config being built right now, so the only question is ""What color?"". Don't need a configurator for that."
2272,"Bear in mind that the production ramp is an exponential curve. Late Oct is possible, but not certain. Literally every day makes a big difference."
2273,"Dec will be a big month, so probably, but it is impossible to be certain right now"
2274,Yeah

2279,Or do you?
2280,High pain tolerance
2281,"Semi specs are better than anything I've seen reported so far. Semi eng/design team work is aces, but other needs are greater right now."
2282,Tesla Semi unveil now Nov 16. Diverting resources to fix Model 3 bottlenecks & increase battery production for Puerto Rico & other affected areas.
2283,Not good. Sounds like some 3rd party installers are taking advantage of Powerwall demand >> supply. Taking action …
2284,The internal Tesla Powerwall install team in PR is very small right now. Sending experienced installers from continental US to hire & train local team as fast as possible.
2285,"Tesla always charges the same price for a Powerwall (only taxes & shipping costs vary), so something is messed up here. I've asked my team to stop shipment to any installers charging excessive premiums."
2286,"Sounds good, I look forward to talking later today"
2287,"I would be happy to talk. Hopefully, Tesla can be helpful."

2293,"The Tesla team has done this for many smaller islands around the world, but there is no scalability limit, so it can be done for Puerto Rico too. Such a decision would be in the hands of the PR govt, PUC, any commercial stakeholders and, most importantly, the people of PR."
2294,Final episode was disgustingly good
2295,I believe I can fly  …

2317,Presentation of @SpaceX Interplanetary Spaceship & Rocket design from 2016  …
2318,That's not a lot of money for a giant like Daimler/Mercedes. Wish they'd do more. Off by a zero.
2319,"Don't give up if the cause is important enough, even if you believe you are walking into doom. Good friends really matter."
2320,"Absolutely. Moreover, we expect to expand the facility significantly over time."
2321,Does my hivemind count as me?
2322,Def not ok. Just sent a reminder to Tesla stores that we just want people to look forward to their next visit. That's what really matters.
2323,In discussions with national govt. Just need a temporary reprieve on local content requirements until we can build a factory in India.

2336,Sorry about that. You're right. I was depressing myself too :(
2337,"Govts don't need to follow normal laws. They will obtain AI developed by companies at gunpoint, if necessary."
2338,Should be low on our list of concerns for civilizational existential risk. NK has no entangling alliances that wd polarize world into war.
2339,"NK launching a nuclear missile would be suicide for their leadership, as SK, US and China wd invade and end the regime immediately"
2340,"May be initiated not by the country leaders, but one of the AI's, if it decides that a prepemptive strike is most probable path to victory"
2341,"China, Russia, soon all countries w strong computer science. Competition for AI superiority at national level most likely cause of WW3 imo."

2344,"Putting together SpaceX rocket landing blooper reel. We messed up a lot before it finally worked, but there's some epic explosion footage …"

2346,In about six months or so. Linked to dual motor config.
2347,We took the SpaceX/Tesla Hyperloop pusher pod for a spin by itself a few days ago to see what it…   
2348,Tunnels are sealed to 5 atmospheres of water & gas pressure. Just need walls around the apertures.
2349,"Not sure, but probably"
2350,Feature coming soon
2351,"They're so real. Anyone going to that much trouble must really care. I'd gladly follow their commands, but they're so friggin obtuse …"
2352,That's pretty much why we did it
2353,"Worth reading Life 3.0 by @Tegmark. AI will be the best or worst thing ever for humanity, so let’s get it right.  …"
2354,Hyperloop (near) vacuum tube runs parallel to SpaceX on Jack Northrop Blvd. It is 0.8 miles long and just under 6 ft in diameter.
2355,"To be clear, a Hyperloop passenger version wouldn't have intense light strobe effect (just for testing), nor uncomfortable acceleration"
2356,Brakes
2357,  …
2358,Will run the SpaceX pusher sled later this week and see what it can do
2359,"Moon base alpha (cheesy show, but I loved it) plus Mars"
2360,"Not that this is remotely equiv to man on the moon, but there is a world of difference between talking about some random idea and doing it"
2361,"Actually, no, his architecture was different. Also, thinking of going to the moon and actually going to the moon are not the same thing."
2362,Hyperloop pod run by team WARR
2363,"The AI could def find us there, but maybe it won't care"
2364,A Model S in The Boring Company tunnel being dug under Los Angeles (starting in Hawthorne)

2368,"No such thing as true vacuum, so actually yes"
2369,Call it ~800mph
2370,"Might be possible to go supersonic in our test Hyperloop tube, even though it's only 0.8 miles long. Very high accel/decel needed …"
2371,"Congratulations to WARR team from Tech Univ Munich for winning 2nd @Hyperloop competition! Peak speed of 324 km/h, which is over 200 mph!!"
2372,Just arrived at the @Hyperloop competition final. Student teams have amazing talent!
2373,I hope they and any others trying to advance transport technology succeed
2374,"Exactly. Wouldn't let anyone invest more than a token amount in early rounds of SpaceX and Tesla, as the probability of failure was >90%."
2375,  …
2376,"Sorry! Coming next year, along with completing the Trans-Canada Highway and interconnecting US, Mexico and Central America."
2377,"Funny thing is, whenever I suggest all companies go to zero incentives, room gets very quiet. That's because others get a lot more than us."
2378,Literally zero incentive laws were put into place by my companies. Zero. Others put them in place. Happy to go to zero incentives for all.
2379,I'm not an investor. Just believe in putting money into my own companies. Don't think the OPM approach is right.
2380,"The latter. There are pretty long gaps between each team run, so livestream is not the way to go."

2385,Let me check on that for you. Found the answer right here: 🔥💩
2386,It was misinterpreted by Rolfe at WSJ as a fundraising effort. Neuralink is not seeking investors.
2387,WSJ has been laboriously negative for over a decade. I'm surprised they haven't bored their readers to death by now.
2388,Neuralink is not raising money
2389,"Max recovered booster velocity was Mach 7.9 (BulgarianSat). Energy is velocity squared, so this is a bigger difference than it appears"
2390,"Max velocity: Mach 6.9 Max altitude: 247 km Highest so far, but velocity matters much more"
2391,Probably 2m or so
2392,Exactly. Yeah.
2393,Intentionally? Yes
2394,It is approximately the size of a carrot

2409,SpaceX rocket factory as seen from space   
2410,"Yeah, but not a priority right now"
2411,I'm not coming for anything. Just digging some tunnels and might draw a vacuum on some of them.
2412,"We are going to move all info and settings to the ""cloud"" (aka server) so any Tesla you drive in the world automatically adjusts to you"
2413,Pics of SpaceX spacesuit developed for NASA commercial crew program coming out next week. Undergoing ocean landing mobility/safety tests.
2414,Totally agree. This was a foolish oversight.
2415,At some point. Features are prioritized by importance * number of owners likely to benefit.
2416,Yeah. That's been on the future feature list for a while. Need to make sure rain sensor doesn't false positive or drain battery.
2417,Will prob do something like that
2418,Problem is possible impact on curbs or ground objects with the car itself or door swing arc
2419,"Will do. Also, we need to make it a lot easier to adjust the headrest."
2420,"Yeah, it should probably automatically adjust to the user config of whoever is closest to a given door when the handle is touched"
2421,Good point. We will add that to all cars in one of the upcoming software releases.
2422,I love Kermit
2423,"But you can check it out on @9GAGTweets. Btw, this isn't a video, like cliff diving or fake rocket landings, that matters if it's reversed."
2424,Wigs me out too much. Deleting ...
2425,"Yes, just that the permitting process is slow"
2426,I want one too!
2427,"Tesla Powerwalls can support houses of any size, but the cool thing is we can tow this house around with a Model X!  …"
2428,"The danger is def high for South Korea, due to proximity, but much less for distant targets like the US. SK anti-missile tech is excellent."
2429,"We certainly could, but, while not suggesting complacency, I'm confident that the US DoD and intelligence orgs have this covered"

2432,For sure
2433,Biggest impediment to recognizing AI danger are those so convinced of their own intelligence they can't imagine anyone doing what they can't
2434,Would like to express our appreciation to Microsoft for use of their Azure cloud computing platform. This required massive processing power.
2435,OpenAI + Dota 2  
2436,It is far too complex for that. Requires a team of the world's best AI researchers with massive computing resources.
2437,"Nobody likes being regulated, but everything (cars, planes, food, drugs, etc) that's a danger to the public is regulated. AI should be too."
2438,"I sure hope so, but we can't take that for granted"
2439,"If you're not concerned about AI safety, you should be. Vastly more risk than North Korea. "
2440,OpenAI first ever to defeat world's best players in competitive eSports. Vastly more complex than traditional board games like chess & Go.

2450,"Of all the bogus anecdotes, this one troubles me the most. Ashlee never actually ran this story by me or my assistant. It is total nonsense."

2507,$US price in $AUD plus import duties and sales tax
2508,We can't have too many direct shareholders or we're required to become a public co. Will check if possible through a feeder fund though.
2509,Often comes as a surprise when people learn that 80% of my time is on engineering/design and just 20% on other stuff  …
2510,A 9m diameter vehicle fits in our existing factories ...
2511,"Yes, I postponed publishing in order to present the updated interplanetary rocket & spaceship design in Adelaide. Will be on the final day."
2512,Discussing physics of tunnels with Mayor Vargas (who has a physics background). Hawthorne support for The Boring Company much appreciated.  …
2513,Kinda have to :)
2514,LA-SF-Reno/Sparks would be great. Tesla logistics costs for Sparks-Fremont (batteries & motors) and Fremont-LA (finished cars) are gigantic.
2515,"Verbal approval was at Federal level. Still a lot of work before formal, written approval, but this opens door for state & city discussions."
2516,Adding Boston and Providence would be the natural extension of the line
2517,"An underground Hyperloop would mean no disruption above ground and be way faster, so I think it is he right way to go"
2518,City of Chicago already approached us about doing a high speed tunnel from O'Hare to downtown. They've been great.
2519,"If you want this to happen fast, please let your local & federal elected representatives know. Makes a big difference if they hear from you."
2520,"Still a lot of work needed to receive formal approval, but am optimistic that will occur rapidly"
2521,For sure. First set of tunnels are to alleviate greater LA urban congestion. Will start NY-DC in parallel. Then prob LA-SF and a TX loop.
2522,Support would be much appreciated!
2523,"City center to city center in each case, with up to a dozen or more entry/exit elevators in each city"
2524,Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop. NY-DC in 29 mins.
2525,"Plan is to do powered landings on Mars for sure, but with a vastly bigger ship"
2526,y
2527,"True. Need to explain full story of Tesla. So much nonsense out there, amplified by propaganda from some in fossil fuels & confused shorts."
2528,Not attacking Electrek. Just making sure people don't have the wrong impression.
2529,Not true. Email from customer.
2530,"I should clarify: Tesla stock is obviously high based on past & present, but low if you believe in Tesla's future. Place bets accordingly …  …"
2531,"Yeah, otherwise hard to find them"
2532,y
2533,"It is true, so fine by me"
2534,"Small thing (very small), but I made it this way for those who care and understand. Source and appearance are the same."
2535,It's what you don't say
2536,I do have one question. What does GoDaddy mean?
2537,Good point
2538,Fixed. Now it's good.
2539,Yes
2540,Stay tuned
2541,I told you it was verbose. Better tomorrow :)
2542,"Excited to announce the launch of   ! It's a little verbose right now, but that will be fixed tomorrow."
2543,Just checked and yes
2544,"True. Also, Ariane primary bay can deliver slightly heavier satellites than Falcon 9. Falcon Heavy is needed ..."
2545,Commercially procured launches means launches that were openly competed. SpaceX is not allowed to compete for many US and non-US launches.
2546,US Senate hearing on advancing the exploration and settlement of space   …
2547,"We do that too, but for free"
2548,Hopefully
2549,"Other orgs shd also develop reusable orbital rockets. If an airplane co had reusable airplanes, buying single use airplanes wd seem crazy. "
2550,That doesn't sound right
2551,"Worth noting that Boeing/Lockheed (""Other US"" on chart) get a billion dollar annual subsidy even if they launch nothing. SpaceX does not.  …"
2552,Latest S and X tires have internal acoustic foam
2553,Going over the small nuances of Model 3 production. Very important that nothing sounds tinny.  …
2554,Cool!
2555,"The very near future, not, like, the far away future"
2556,"You can now drive anywhere in the US (except N Alaska), most of Europe, China & Japan using the Tesla Supercharger network!  …"
2557,Of course!
2558,"On University Ave, above the old bakery"
2559,"One of my sons is named Xavier, after Professor X!"
2560,That's probably the best use
2561,Cool 😎
2562,Maybe the upcoming IAC in Adelaide
2563,"It was a tough negotiation, but they seemed like good guys. I hope they kept the stock. Would be worth a lot today."
2564,"That pizza looked about as appetizing as drywall. If anything, they were doing people at the party a favor by taking it."
2565,"Wasn't wearing a suit, am def not part of a ""posse"" & didn't even know Leo/Orlando were going. Just went to say hi to my friend Ken Howery."
2566,"Thanks PayPal for allowing me to buy back   ! No plans right now, but it has great sentimental value to me."
2567,First Production Model 3
2568,"It's who is first to pay full price for the car. Hard rule. I have first Roadster and X, but not first S."
2569,"Ira Ehrenpreis had rights to 1st car as he was 1st to place a full deposit, but gave those rights to me as my 46th bday present. Tks Ira!"
2570,Production unit 1 of Model 3 is now built and going through final checkout. Pics soon.
2571,Never heard of them
2572,Stop biting my finger dammit    …  …
2573,This will be the highest power battery system in the world by a factor of 3. Australia rocks!!  …
2574,"The world's population is accelerating towards collapse, but few seem to notice or care"
2575,"Thanks @INTELSAT! Really proud of the rocket and SpaceX team today. Min apogee requirement was 28,000 km, Falcon 9 achieved 43,000 km."
2576,SpaceX team reviewed all systems again late last night. Done our best to ensure all is good.  …
2577,We're going to spend the 4th doing a full review of rocket & pad systems. Launch no earlier than 5th/6th. Only one chance to get it right …
2578,Wanted to say thanks to all that own or ordered a Tesla. It matters to us that you took a risk on a new car company. We won't forget.
2579,"Looks like we can reach 20,000 Model 3 cars per month in Dec"
2580,"Handover party for first 30 customer Model 3's on the 28th! Production grows exponentially, so Aug should be 100 cars and Sept above 1500."
2581,Model 3 passed all regulatory requirements for production two weeks ahead of schedule. Expecting to complete SN1 on Friday
2582,Norway is awesome
2583,"Actually, China manufacturing quality is excellent. Among other things, that's where iPhones, many Android phones & most laptops are made."
2584,Another SpaceX launch today if weather is good  …
2585,Coming later today
2586,Sorry to hear about China launch failure today. I know how painful that is to the people who designed & built it.  …
2587,Suggestions welcome!
2588,I think Einstein said that
2589,Or does the Earth move up?
2590,This is a really great floor
2591,Just installed steel skeleton of the car/pod elevator. Should be operating next week.
2592,Across the road and below the ground
2593,Perspective
2594,"Nothing to be done, but wait. It's all right here:   …"
2595,News on Sunday
2596,Because it's off the wall
2597,Maybe it is time for the man cape to return
2598,Didn't read it. Might now though.
2599,Exactly
2600,Me too
2601,"Yes, but arguably that's worse"
2602,And I don't care who knows it. Our love will never die.
2603,Just try one. It's way better than you think.
2604,A floor that moves
2605,A ceiling is simply a floor from below
2606,Not as much as tunnels though
2607,They are so underappreciated
2608,They will never let you down
2609,I love floors
2610,Gary (the snail) is a speed demon. Long way to go before we beat him/her.
2611,"Thanks, but I am"
2612,No longer waiting for Godot. It has begun boring and just completed the first segment of tunnel in LA.
2613,"Good summary of rocket landing history. There were two successful water landings much earlier, but they didn't survive long.  …"
2614,"Several tons of force on each fin at high angles of attack & peak heating is the cube of speed, so a Mach 8 reentry is 8X Mach 4. Intense."
2615,They should on high velocity missions to Geostationary Transfer Orbit
2616,Sped up version of today's rocket landing on the Droneship Just Read the Instructions (guess it…   
2617,More aero effectiveness to create steep spires on windward side at the grid fin intersections
2618,"Down the road, they will not even be repainted between launches. Aiming to be able to relaunch same orbital rocket booster in <24 hours."
2619,Getting closer to fairing recovery and reuse. Had some problems with the steerable parachute. Should have it sorted out by end of year.
2620,New titanium grid fins worked even better than expected. Should be capable of an indefinite number of flights with no service.
2621,Still humans
2622,Significantly improves control force
2623,Launch at 1:25 delivering 10 satellites for Iridium. Droneship repositioned due to extreme weather. Will be tight.   
2624,"Closeup of the titanium grid fins. Not painted, as they glow red hot during a fast reentry. "
2625,"We used to have a (lame) open loop hydraulic system, but that was upgraded to closed about 2 years ago"
2626,"Not only that, it has all the wifis and 3G is coming soon"
2627,Rocket was suddenly slammed sideways right before landing. Heavy gust or something malfunctioned onboard. Reviewing telemetry.
2628,"True, but that's a minor factor for rockets"
2629,"No, but shielding got fragged every flight. More control authority is for Falcon Heavy, but also enables Falcon 9 to land in heavier winds."
2630,"They will, but the hydraulic system is closed loop, so no fluid lost. They do need more power & energy, but rocket has plenty of that."
2631,"Slightly heavier than shielded aluminum, but more control authority and can be reused indefinitely with no touch ups"
2632,Flying with larger & significantly upgraded hypersonic grid fins. Single piece cast & cut titanium. Can take reentry heat with no shielding.  …
2633,Sticking to 100
2634,"It's an aluminum honeycomb cartridge, so only a couple of hours to replace"
2635,"Rocket is extra toasty and hit the deck hard (used almost all of the emergency crush core), but otherwise good"
2636,Falcon 9 will experience its highest ever reentry force and heat in today's launch. Good chance rocket booster doesn't make it back.
2637,"Technically, Ironyman"
2638,Thanks! Looks cool.
2639,"Damn, I forgot bacon"
2640,"In life, there are no easy choices …"
2641,Do want irony on social media?
2642,Must remember that irony and social media are not friends. Keep forgetting. Dammit.
2643,Radiation
2644,Groan
2645,"But RWD with electric is really good in snow (assuming all weather or winter tires), as traction control is far more precise"
2646,Will extend
2647,Over 1000 km should be possible in a 100D with the right tires  …
2648,Will be full regen cooled all the way out to the 3 meter (10 ft) nozzle diameter. Heat flux is nuts & radiative view factor is low.
2649,"No plans to change 100 kWh pack tech. You'll never worry about running out of range. Model 3 pack is about cost reduction, not performance."
2650,No need to rely on scientists for global warming -- just use a thermometer  …
2651,Cool
2652,"That's because the accurate articles are boringly obvious, so they get no press attention"
2653,"First approximation of CO2 is production cost, factoring in energy source, so Model 3 obv less CO2 to produce than $35k gas car by a lot"
2654,Calling this cueless would be generous. Much less energy required for lithium-ion batteries & Gigafactory is powered by renewables anyway.
2655,No plans to change cell form factor for X and S
2656,"This is crazy, but Max Smart mentions Chaos towards the end. Coincidence?"
2657,There's a plot!?
2658,ujelly?
2659,"My real phone is an HTC Droid, which I ordered after seeing this ad  …"
2660,Nothing beats the shoe phone that is also a real shoe  …
2661,But then I get paid less
2662,"Backup valve shows no sign of leaking, but yeah"
2663,If schedule holds there will be two Falcon 9 launches within 48 hours (Cape & Vandenberg) this weekend  …
2664,"Postponing launch to replace fairing pneumatic valve. It is dual redundant, but not worth taking a chance.  …"
2665,"Promising conversations with @MayorOfLA regarding tunnel network that would carry cars, bikes & pedestrians. Permits harder than technology.  …"
2666,  …
2667,It's time they knew …
2668,Tesla service rescues a kitten stuck in the bumper      
2669,So soon you won't believe it
2670,Colonizing Mars (thanks Prof Hubbard for creating this from my talk). Major changes to the plan coming soon.   …
2671,"Hawthorne, California "
2672,Flying through the Falcon Factory   
2673,"Mars V2 plan coming soon, which I think addresses the most fundamental flaw in V1: how to pay for development & operation of giant rockets  …"
2674,Radar-only braking on HW1 is getting better with every release. We're hoping to do the demo where it brakes for a UFO in the fog soon.
2675,"$300M cost diff between SpaceX and Boeing/Lockheed exceeds avg value of satellite, so flying with SpaceX means satellite is basically free  …"
2676,In discussions with the government of India requesting temporary relief on import penalties/restrictions until a local factory is built
2677,US govt testing by @NHTSAgov finds Model X to be the safest SUV in history by significant margin  …
2678,"That would an interesting target. Would, of course, only count if capable of doing so right off the production line with street legal tires."
2679,How'd you know?
2680,"Linux kernel update was way harder than anticipated. Giant improvement, but meant way more OS overhead tuning to keep screen frame rate good"
2681,"New kernel goes out next weekend, new web browser next month. Radar-only braking is getting steadily better for both HW 1 and 2."
2682,HW2 Autopilot release should go wide next weekend with additional smoothness improvements to longitudinal control
2683,"We are developing the interplanetary rocket and spaceship to allow anyone to travel to the moon, Mars & beyond, regardless of nationality"
2684,Thanks! Everything we make on the expensive cars goes into developing more affordable cars.
2685,Thanks for supporting Tesla and the EV mission before anyone had heard of us
2686,Heard about it. Our experience doing projects with big car companies was not great. They move slowly & are reluctant to adopt new tech.
2687,"I've written two forward-looking master plans, but haven't told the Tesla history of how we got there. Lot of drama … Prob worth doing?"
2688,Mostly right. The feasibility study Martin commissioned about the Lotus Elise was dead wrong though. Only 7% of parts ended up being common.
2689,"Slow at first, then very fast. Def not hover."
2690,"The faster, the better. Gravity losses."
2691,Damn Stonecutters!
2692,"Was no ""company"", just a (wrong) biz plan to commercialize ACP's Tzero car. No tech or IP, no employees & didn't even own Tesla Motors name."
2693,"Disruption certainly. Deep AI is the real risk, though, not automation."
2694,Exactly
2695,Congrats Robb!  …
2696,So crazy that people were arrested for trying to keep their cars from being destroyed
2697,You may have Heard of the person who put it together
2698,"Worth watching ""Who Killed the Electric Car?"" By @chrispaine. Truth is indeed stranger than fiction …   …"
2699,"If Zedd is kind enough to send me a list, it's on"
2700,"All Superchargers are being converted to solar/battery power. Over time, almost all will disconnect from the electricity grid."
2701,"I love Norway, which is the world leader in EV adoption! Great example for the rest of the world."
2702,"Long way to go, but we've convinced most of the auto industry to start EV programs & gave them all our patents to help, so that's something"
2703,"Nothing to do w govt incentives or making money. Thought 90% prob of losing it all (almost did many times), but it was the only chance."
2704,"Since big car companies were killing their EV programs, the only chance was to create an EV company, even tho it was almost certain to fail"
2705,"They was done against the will of their owners, who held a candlelight vigil all night to protest the death of their cars"
2706,Few people know that we started Tesla when GM forcibly recalled all electric cars from customers in 2003 & then crushed them in a junkyard
2707,That is true. Ludicrous mode is like having pure joy on tap. Nothing else (legal) will get you that.
2708,Click the left scroll wheel to pause or mute music
2709,"Good point, will add ""cancel nav"" to voice commands"
2710,Too awesome
2711,Must ipso facto half not bee
2712,"First of all, I cracked a long time ago. That's not news. Second, yes, I can see time. How did you know?"
2713,"Yeah, car should auto play when it gets an exact match, like it does for directions. Will make that change."
2714,Just confirmed the Tesla DJ station works in Canada
2715,Cool
2716,"No, it's not!"
2717,Yes
2718,Tap cancel on the screen
2719,"Just tap the voice button on the steering wheel and say ""Play Monty Python"" or ""Navigate home"" or anything. Voice commands work pretty well."
2720,"Just depends on whether you like a sedan or SUV. Sedan goes faster, SUV has more room."
2721,"Yeah, coming back"
2722,Coming soon!
2723,Partly
2724,Possibly my favorite skit
2725,Might work in Canada too
2726,I mean also
2727,Not yet
2728,Yeah
2729,"In the US, you can ask your Tesla to play any Monty Python (or other comedy) skit. Doesn't work outside US yet."
2730,"It's on the car. Might add it to the Tesla app at some point, so you get it on your phone if you have a Powerwall or Tesla solar."
2731,My favorite for sure
2732,Try the new Tesla DJ station on streaming radio
2733,The scene where Brian is saved from the Romans by falling off a tower into a spaceship is the best Deus Ex Machina moment of any movie ever
2734,"All Falcon Heavy cores should be at the Cape in two to three months, so launch should happen a month after that"
2735,Love Monty Python so much

2737,"Just wish they would stop sticking pins in voodoo dolls of me. That hurts, ok?"
2738,Yeah
2739,Yeah
2740,These guys want us to die so bad they can taste it
2741,Could be worse  …
2742,"We can either give up hope & sit in traffic hell forever or try something new. The odds of success may be low, but they're better than zero."
2743,The Boring Company is in Hawthorne and has already approved the permit
2744,Thanks :) Such an outrageous lawsuit. People sometimes underestimate strength of US judiciary. Lot of respect for the judge & jury system.
2745,Read  …
2746,Almost. Falcon Heavy was way harder to develop than it seemed at first.
2747,"Once you add the vintage record player, it's all good"

2752,Seems that way
2753,Of course. What base-number system were you using?
2754,That's why the pic is in black and white. Didn't have color back then.
2755,"Yeah, I counted"
2756,Tesla shareholder meeting today. Can't believe it's been 1000 years since we went public.   
2757,"This is a metaphor for transparency. Also, f* underwear."
2758,Obviously
2759,"SEC disclosures, etc"
2760,"I'm not *saying* they're related, but …  …"
2761,Or is it more about the way you use it?  …
2762,I hope I'm wrong
2763,"Probably closer to 2030 to 2040 imo. 2060 would be a linear extrapolation, but progress is exponential.  …"
2764,Great comedy! They should write for @TheOnion.
2765,Most likely
2766,"Also, we will have a very high headcount around each Gigafactory keeping it running. They just won't be doing boring, repetitive tasks."
2767,Probably closer to four or five factories. Logistics costs mean you want to be close to the end customer.
2768,California Cabernet

2773,"Most people don't realize you can see Dragon approach the Space Station from the ground, even in LA"
2774,Proud of my Mom ❤️   …
2775,"Yeah, pretty much dead center. We painted the target area with radio reflective paint, which helps the radar be more precise."
2776,Exactly
2777,It's starting to feel kinda normal to reuse rockets. Good. That's how it is for cars & airplanes and how it should be for rockets.
2778,First reflight of a Dragon spacecraft set for later today  …
2779,Good point :)
2780,India commits to sell only electric cars by 2030. It is already the largest market for solar power.  …
2781,"Under Paris deal, China committed to produce as much clean electricity by 2030 as the US does from all sources today  …"
2782,Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.
2783,Coming soon
2784,Yeah :)
2785,Will have no choice but to depart councils in that case
2786,"Don't know which way Paris will go, but I've done all I can to advise directly to POTUS, through others in WH & via councils, that we remain"
2787,And then some
2788,"Yeah, it was great!"

2793,Yes
2794,Should finish trans-Canada this year. A stop in Swift Current for sure!
2795,Yes
2796,Comparing Model S vs Model 3   
2797,Old-school fidget spinner back when the only things to play with were squirrels and rocks   
2798,There will be a combined booster static fire. Maybe a few.
2799,"Btw, that cloud is almost entirely steam, including dark parts (like a storm). This is what the launch looks like:  …"
2800,"Falcon Heavy is this times three. One way or another, launch is guaranteed to be exciting ...  …"
2801,Will shut that down. The point is to provide something special that only existing owners can give to friends and it is limited to 5 people.
2802,Only if you want pure joy mainlined straight into your brain
2803,You are right. Going at max speed. Not much time left.
2804,Busted
2805,Will keep the original Bond Lotus sub as-is. That design can't actually convert from car to sub. Have a new design in mind that does.
2806,True :)
2807,Feel exactly the same way as A.O. Scott. Particularly loved The Spy Who Loved Me   …
2808,All Model S and X cars will have an auto raise and lower function for the steering wheel in a few months.
2809,I spoke directly with The President three weeks ago about Paris. Many others have too. Cautiously optimistic of a positive decision.
2810,Interesting idea. Would give a dynamic 360 deg surround view as you're driving. Have this in dev mode. Can be a bit distracting though.
2811,"Early next year. To start with, we're making the simplest Model 3 first, like we did with S. Didn't do it with X, because I was an idiot."
2812,We could add that function pretty easily from a technical standpoint. Just need to add in the billing software.
2813,"Can be set higher than that for highways, but limited to +5mph or +8km/h off highway (true avg drive speed) for pedestrian & cyclist safety"
2814,Exactly
2815,Still on for end of year. Just software limited. Any Tesla car with HW2 (all cars built since Oct last year) will be able to do this.
2816,There's just no way. Hundreds of parts and most of wiring harness would have to be replaced. Would cost more to retrofit than trading in.
2817,HW2. HW1 doesn't have enough sensors and computing power.
2818,Hopefully June for those too
2819,S for sure. It is a bigger car.
2820,"I'd highly recommend upgrading to latest Model S (which is approx version 4). Only if you really want a smaller sedan, should you get a 3."
2821,"Maybe I'm misinformed, but I was told that 30% of parts must be locally sourced and the supply doesn't yet exist in India to support that."
2822,"Yeah, control algorithm is safe, but unpleasant. New one is even safer, but super smooth."
2823,"Almost there, plus much improved web browser"
2824,That will be tied to deliveries of the first production cars in July
2825,Almost there. Probably in a few months.
2826,"You can easily turn it off in the car via settings, but that would beg the question of why you turned it off :)"
2827,Something cool for sure
2828,Excited about the Tesla Autopilot software release rolling out next month. New control algorithm feels as smooth as silk.
2829,"Model 3, Model X & Model S will all have same level of Autopilot capability. It's just a matter of refining the vision & control software."
2830,Wear underpants
2831,Will do
2832,Black and textured slate versions will be
2833,Yes
2834,"For reason I can't explain, I find #2 especially odd. Also, not a fan of #17. Has led too many people astray in valuing securities."
2835,"Still agree with Tim's points. What ""you"" are is an evolving, mind-body pattern, but there's still a core youness that holds true over time."
2836,"Heisenberg's uncertainty principle & practical limits of simultaneity in transfer make this exact thought experiment impossible, but … yeah"
2837,We got stuck
2838,All the answers to questions you never asked about holes in the ground  
2839,What pun?

2845,"Gary the snail is like Speedy Gonzales on meth ... or ambien. One of the two. Either way, Godot, our tunnel machine, is still a distant 2nd."
2846,And ... it's done
2847,Worked in Minecraft. Just sayin ...
2848,Of course. Why is that even a question?
2849,Imma gonna dig that tunnel with this here hammer
2850,My grandmother was from Moose Jaw
2851,Going to a barn raising!
2852,"On my cousin's farm in Canada at 17, wearing a hat on a hat "
2853,"Yeah, worked on the farm when I was 17"
2854,"Family history article. Was born in South Africa, but named after my American great-grandfather.  …"
2855,Yes
2856,"[Warning, this may cause motion sickness or seizures] This is a test run of our electric sled…   "
2857,"The race between Gary, our pet snail who lives in a pineapple, and Godot, our tunnel boring…   "
2858,Boring machine segments have been lowered into the starter tunnel. Going through final assembly.…   
2859,Cutterhead in operation at standard industry speed. Planning to jack this up by a factor of ten…   
2860,First tunnel for The Boring Company begins ... Full length of first tunnel will run from LAX to…   
2861,"Entry hole, staging area and starting tunnel for Boring Machine 1 (aka Godot) now complete   "
2862,"Tesla needs to iterate fast on solar roof prefab/install technology, so all installs will be done by Tesla techs at first"
2863,Third one will be from Frost. Maybe the second.
2864,Yes. Good.
2865,"First machine is Godot. Still waiting ... Don't know why, when or where."
2866,Naming theme for tunnel boring machines will be poems & plays. Decided against plays & poems. Too obvious.
2867,That's how the tiles sit on the roof. There is no difference in strength for the Tesla tile based on orientation (not like wood).
2868,This is true. The economics are not yet compelling where housing and utility costs are low and property taxes are high.
2869,Slo-mo hail cannonball impacting Tesla solar roof tile   
2870,"Will do our best. Hopefully, yes."
2871,Yes
2872,Solar roof can be ordered for almost any country. Deployment this year in the US and overseas next year.
2873,Black glass smooth and textured will be first. Tuscan and French Slate in about six months.
2874,U.K. delivery and installation next year
2875,Yes
2876,Tesla solar glass roof orders open this afternoon. I think it will be great. More in about 10 hours ...
2877,"If heat death of the universe is the destination, it really is all about the journey   …   …"
2878,It's a good one
2879,Thanks for doing it!
2880,Headed to see Guardians 2 w my bro and kids. Loved the first one.
2881,"I do love Banks, but perhaps we should reserve his names for the droneships"
2882,Simple. I like it.
2883,Kinda like Snoop Dug
2884,I don't want to be presumptuous
2885,"I know what you're thinking … then why not ""the Third""? Well, I've learned my lesson about 3's."
2886,"By calling it ""the Second"", it has more credibility"
2887,"Maybe Ultimate Boring Machine, the Second"
2888,Boring Not Boring
2889,Good one
2890,Been done
2891,Thinking about a name for our first tunneling machine …
2892,Was just rereading one of my favorites. So beautiful …  …
2893,"Close-up of rocket stage separation, fast flip, boostback burn in a ring of fire and then…   "
2894,Landing   
2895,"Launch and landing of the NRO spy satellite was good. Tough call, as high altitude wind shear was at 98.6% of the theoretical load limit. "
2896,"Winds aloft are unusually high (still within structural safety bounds). Worrying, but not a showstopper.  …"
2897,"Yeah, will probably publish an update in six weeks or so"

2906,Will definitely do that on my next trip
2907,"Having moo moo at Moo Moo Gold Coast with amberheard, @CreepyPuppet and @CowanFilms   "
2908,That is the aspiration: to avoid AI becoming other.
2909,"Yeah, sorry I missed that. This would only work for 75 kWh packs that are software created to 60, so not 2013."
2910,Yes
2911,Tesla will soon be offering a compelling means of upgrading a 60 to a 75
2912,July
2913,Pickup truck unveil in 18 to 24 months
2914,Next gen Roadster will be convertible
2915,Tesla Semi truck unveil set for September. Team has done an amazing job. Seriously next level.
2916,Yeah
2917,"Besides, I already said we'd add more independent members during SCTY merger. Will announce soon, but this group has nothing to do with it."
2918,This investor group should buy Ford stock. Their governance is amazing ...
2919,Autolist survey finds Tesla used car values are highest and sell fastest  …
2920,"Fairing is ~$5M, but that should be reusable this year. Am fairly confident we can reuse upper stage too by late next year to get to 100%."
2921,Latency should only be 5 min max. Checking ...
2922,Feature coming soon that allows one touch access to all discovered Tesla Easter eggs
2923,And so the robots spared humanity ...  …
2924,"Exactly. Tesla is absurdly overvalued if based on the past, but that's irrelevant. A stock price represents risk-adjusted future cash flows."

2927,Coal is dying due to nat gas fracking. It's basically dead.

2933,"Def P100D with Ludicrous+, although the rocket starts going a lot faster after that"
2934,We can def bring it back like Dragon. Just a question of how much weight we need to add.
2935,Working on it
2936,Looks like it could do 20% more with some structural upgrades to handle higher loads. But that's in fully expendable mode.
2937,A lot
2938,Silliest thing we can imagine! Secret payload of 1st Dragon flight was a giant wheel of cheese. Inspired by a friend & Monty Python.
2939,"Good point, odds go from 0% to >0% :)"
2940,Falcon Heavy test flight currently scheduled for late summer
2941,"Considering trying to bring upper stage back on Falcon Heavy demo flight for full reusability. Odds of success low, but maybe worth a shot."
2942,Browser is already a little better. Kernel and browser update in prob 6 weeks or so (lots of underlying changes) with a few nice features.
2943,Thanks Phil!
2944,Incredibly proud of the SpaceX team for achieving this milestone in space! Next goal is reflight within 24 hours.
2945,"If you just downloaded V8.1, tap the the T on center screen three times"
2946,"On center screen. Also, center screen *will* show speed as an overlay that changes opacity according to relevance."
2947,Very few. We have yet to do a China (or Europe) launch of Model 3.
2948,Glad to have Tencent as an investor and advisor to Tesla
2949,No
2950,You won't care
2951,What gave me away?
2952,No
2953,Here is the latest SpaceX travel ad for the flight around the moon & into deep space. Maybe needs a few edits ...  …
2954,"Long Neuralink piece coming out on @waitbutwhy in about a week. Difficult to dedicate the time, but existential risk is too high not to."
2955,We cannot make all country versions simultaneously or the production start would be a disaster. You would get first in Norway.
2956,Yes
2957,Yes
2958,I believe so
2959,Yup
2960,Oh so little faith
2961,The shorter wheelbase only allows for a 75 kWh pack in Model 3 at current cell/module energy densities
2962,Yeah
2963,Start taking orders in April
2964,"Yeah, probably a year from now. S will still win on acceleration though, due to having more space for a larger battery."
2965,"Only Model S will have the seven seater option, more cargo space, plus higher range, acceleration, two screens vs one, auto extend handles …"
2966,The Model S produced today is arguably version 4. Let me put it this way: it is the car I will keep driving even after Model 3 arrives.
2967,"If fate is on our side, it will be amazing. Will talk about that in detail next week."
2968,No problem :)
2969,"Should be summer next year. Sorry, really wish we could get RHD done sooner. We truly are working as fast as we can."
2970,Let me just go fetch my magic wand ...
2971,"First in line for dual motor as soon as we can make it, which is probably in 6 to 9 months."
2972,Damn straight we do! Coming with 8.1 next week.
2973,First drive of a release candidate version of Model 3
2974,It still has one display
2975,Nothing majorly new that a consumer would notice. Lots of new tech in the design and production process though.
2976,"The more autonomous a car is, the less dash info you need. How often do you look at the instrument panel when being driven in a taxi?"
2977,How about the video we just took of the first Model 3 release candidate drive?
2978,"Yup, machine arrives next month and we start digging the tunnel!"
2979,I think so
2980,"No, we are minimizing configuration complexity to keep the production ramp on schedule. RWD only for early production, just like Model S."
2981,Tues/Wed
2982,Because I was a dumb idiot and didn't realize at the time that it would cause confusion
2983,Tues/Wed next week
2984,"Yes. Model S will always be the fastest Tesla until next gen Roadster, which is a few years away."
2985,"Yes, but not until next year"
2986,Yes. Hardware already on all production S and X cars.
2987,"Sorta. Model 3 is like a BMW 3 series or Audi A4. Model S is like BMW 5 and 6 series, but much faster, more storage space + Autopilot"
2988,How about now?
2989,Oh Model Y is coming too in a few years. Kinda have to.
2990,All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as software improves
2991,Definitely
2992,"Model 3 was going to be called Model E, for obvious dumb humor reasons, but Ford sued to block it, so now it is S3X. Totally different :)"
2993,Yes
2994,"Model 3 is just a smaller, more affordable version of Model S w less range & power & fewer features. Model S has more advanced technology."
2995,"Am noticing that many people think Model 3 is the ""next version"" of a Tesla, like iPhone 2 vs 3. This is not true."
2996,Looking forward to playing the game with my kids!
2997,"I used to be one. You're welcome. Trying my best, at least. Hope it's a bit useful."
2998,Just because I'm building a spaceship to get back to my home planet doesn't mean I'm an alien
2999,The number of extinct single planet civilizations probably exceeds live civs by at least a thousand to one. I'm being optimistic.
3000,"Probably. Either that, simulation, great filter or they are very, very subtle."
3001,I hope that didn't work
3002,~spawn npc.alien
3003,Where are the #%*> aliens?  …
3004,Looks like Tues/Wed for 8.1 release
3005,Except that isn't actually my house ...
3006,"Perhaps there will be some future bill that makes a difference for Mars, but this is not it."
3007,I am not. This bill changes almost nothing about what NASA is doing. Existing programs stay in place and there is no added funding for Mars.
3008,"3 is a great car, but definitely Model S"
3009,Good point
3010,I wish. It's so annoying.
3011,"Finally, an explanation for daylight savings that makes sense ...  …"
3012,Ok
3013,"It's been a bear to get done, but prob 10 days or so, depending on full speed autosteer test results"
3014,"Looking forward to it. I know it's cliche, but LotR is my favorite book ever :) Want to see the set and take my kids on tour of greater NZ."
3015,"Sure. Just check out my prior tweet on pricing ($250 kWh at pack level). Website will be updated soon, so there is complete transparency."
3016,"Can only happen with your support, and working closely with key govt and utility leaders who are strongly committed to trying new approaches"
3017,"Just wanted to write a note of appreciation to the many Australians who came out in support of the battery plan, especially @mcannonbrookes"
3018,I love Wikipedia. Just gets better over time.
3019,"Answer is complex for electric motors. We use an AC induction motor fed by a DC pack thru an IGBT inverter, which kinda ""digitizes"" DC power"
3020,High voltage DC is for sure the best way to transmit electricity over long distances. Good explanation at   …
3021,"Ironically, direct current is the right approach today, even though alternating was right in the past. Solar power & electronics both DC."
3022,You're most welcome. Very exciting to discuss the future of electricity. Renewables + storage arguably biggest disruption since DC to AC.  …
3023,"Just spoke with @JayWeatherill, Premier of South Australia. Very impressed. Govt is clearly committed to a smart, quick solution."
3024,"Yes, but shipping, taxes/tariffs and installation labor vary by country, as those costs are beyond our control"
3025,$250/kWh at the pack level for 100MWh+ systems. Tesla is moving to fixed and open pricing and terms for all products.
3026,Tesla will get the system installed and working 100 days from contract signature or it is free. That serious enough for you?
3027,Will send you one
3028,Self-hatred
3029,Thanks JJ!
3030,Thank you for the lovely letter. That sounds like a great idea. We'll do it!  …
3031,SpaceX could not do this without NASA. Can't express enough appreciation.  …
3032,"This is not true. TM works for a lot of people and that's great, but I've maybe done it 7 or 8 times ever."
3033,Fly me to the moon ... Ok  …
3034,SpaceX announcement tomorrow at 1pm PST
3035,of course
3036,maybe one of those too
3037,Roller coasters are awesome
3038,Something on a tristate border might work. Gigafactory plus nearby supporting supply chain needs a very large workforce.
3039,Good chance it will
3040,Exactly :)
3041,I didn't pose for it (hopefully that's obvious) or want me on cover. Tunnel boring machine pic wd be way better
3042,Minor improvements update this weekend. High speed autosteer in about two weeks.
3043,Excellent Tesla Model X review  …
3044,Just posted a video   
3045,Baby came back   
3046,no
3047,System was green for launch. I called it off.
3048,"They are often right, but, in this case, we have already retired so much R&D risk on Dragon 2, that I feel very confident of 2018."
3049,"Uses high pressure bleed off the fuel side (RP-1 kerosene) turbopump, so no dedicated pump or fluid needed"
3050,"Btw, 99% likely to be fine (closed loop TVC wd overcome error), but that 1% chance isn't worth rolling the dice. Better to wait a day."
3051,"Not obviously related to the (very tiny) helium leak, but also not out of the question"
3052,"If this is the only issue, flight would be fine, but need to make sure that it isn't symptomatic of a more significant upstream root cause"
3053,"All systems go, except the movement trace of an upper stage engine steering hydraulic piston was slightly odd. Standing down to investigate."
3054,Counting down to the first SpaceX launch from the Apollo 11 launch pad tomorrow morning (webcast…   
3055,spacex's photo   
3056,"Provided Dragon 2 demo missions go well, SpaceX is highly confident of being able to fly US astronauts in 2018  …"
3057,Looks like we are go for launch. Added an abort trigger at T-60 secs for pressure decay of upper stage helium spin start system.
3058,"Investigating a (very small) leak in the upper stage. If ok, will launch tomorrow.  …"
3059,"Yes, but only deep in solid rock, where the walls are self-supporting and concrete reinforcements arguably aren't needed"
3060,It's much easier to do the CGI that way
3061,Daylight rocket launch & landing at the Cape this weekend. Will be the 1st SpaceX flight from the Apollo launch pad.  …
3062,I used that one :)
3063,"Ok, what are some good ones? Will have to meter these out. Hopefully, kids can't die from groaning too much."
3064,They are doing India proud
3065,You may come to regret that request :)
3066,"Yeah, exactly. So that makes it cool, right!?"
3067,"Yeah, awesome achievement by ISRO. Very impressive!"
3068,"Apparently, there is this thing called ""Dad jokes"" and I make them"
3069,"You're right, I can't hide any more! I am Irony Man..."
3070,they were earlier drafts that I accidentally published. I said the same thing a week already.
3071,"In appreciation, Tesla is providing all repair costs free of charge and expedited.  …"
3072,Congrats to the Tesla owner who sacrificed damage to his own car to bring a car with an unconscious driver safely to a stop!
3073,Best place to watch is on the Cape causeway
3074,Sounds like the Tesla Powerwall (consumer) and Powerpack (utility/commercial) might be useful
3075,Falcon 9 rocket now vertical at Cape Canaveral on launch complex 39-A. This is the same launch…   
3076,Exactly. What this person said is untrue.
3077,"Please check your facts. Tesla and SpaceX joined as soon as we received the filing, which was Monday."
3078,of course it will
3079,Should all be uploaded by next month
3080,Motor Trend could only achieve 2.4 sec when they tested the Porsche 918
3081,I don't know what make you think that's a rocket. It's completely covered in a tarpaulin...
3082,George Schultz and Jim Baker article in @WSJ regarding a carbon tax  …
3083,yes
3084,Hoping for summer this year
3085,"yes, altitude improves performance for electric. Opposite of combustion cars."
3086,"No, will be lower. Wheelbase can't fit 100."
3087,"Also, Tesla service can remove front trunk liner if you don't use it and improve performance further"
3088,"No plans to take X, S (or 3) above 100 kWh. Semi necessarily and pickup truck maybe will go above."
3089,Take out the floor mats and its 2.27. MT said everything had to be standard production.
3090,yes
3091,Production Tesla Model S P100DL sets Motor Trend all-time world record to 60 mph in 2.27 sec  
3092,Signing off now. That was more than enough Twitter trouble for one morning!
3093,No rare earth metals in battery
3094,Almost ready
3095,App update is about two weeks out. Linux kernel and browser update probably a month or so. HW2 Autopilot has priority.
3096,"Yes, but Model 3 is the overwhelming priority"
3097,I will post an article he wrote half a century ago about flying through Africa and Asia in his plane. One of my favorite things.
3098,Almost there. We are just being very careful with the rollout.
3099,A lot of terrible things could happen in four years of extremism. Do you really want another war? That's where extremism leads.
3100,"Yeah, it is hard to convey complex ideas in 140 chars and tone is lost in text"
3101,People should push to have as many moderates advising the President as possible. Blind hate is never the right answer.
3102,Rolling out a new update today.
3103,We should try our best
3104,"Really? Ok, I will work harder on thinking first and tweeting second. Sorry for anything thoughtless."
3105,I just had three coffees :)
3106,Mars is critical for the long-term survival of humanity and life on Earth as we know it
3107,Numeric
3108,Gravimetric energy density of batteries and achieving a high cell mass fraction
3109,"I love Canada! I'm half Canadian. My Mom was born in Regina. My grandfather (her Dad) was American, born in Minnesota."
3110,Me too. I hope to get back to regularly scheduled programming soon ...
3111,"I agree, great country! Looking forward to taking my kids for a visit. I've heard it is incredibly beautiful."
3112,Really? I already have both feet in my mouth and am levitating on my own idiocy...
3113,True. Me being one of them :)
3114,"Not perfect & cd be better, but 10th out of 200+ countries with only a 0.08 diff to ""1st"" place means it's essentially on par"
3115,"Fair point, sorry"
3116,"Activists should be pushing for more moderates to advise President, not fewer. How could having only extremists advise him possibly be good?"
3117,Needs a major overhaul
3118,Exactly
3119,Norway is great on all levels. Love Norway!
3120,Yeah. And Twitter is a hater Hellscape.
3121,"Good grief, I'm not ""working"" for Trump. I'm trying to provide advice that helps take things in a more positive direction."
3122,"Actually, I think it's kinda cool :)"
3123,Isn't that basically like having a jury of peers? That is a default option in the US.
3124,"Those countries have strong justice systems, but I'd put them roughly on par with US. That rating system conflates many factors."
3125,Did you read my tweets? I attacked it hard. Did not defend.
3126,You're right. Politics is a no-win situation. Somebody is going to hate what you say no matter what that is.
3127,Also good. There are several that are on par with US. Just don't think any are better. People confuse laws with courts.
3128,Mostly anti-drug laws
3129,Exactly
3130,"The laws need to change. Judges are responsible for evaluating whether an action breaks the law, not making law."
3131,The remedy for that is changing the law
3132,"Ok, but what's up the wigs?"
3133,There are many good legal systems on par with US. Just don't know any that are better.
3134,True!
3135,"Many in America don't realize how proud they should be of the legal system. Not perfect, but nowhere is the cause of justice better served."
3136,Walking down the street and saw this
3137,I wish!
3138,"Then so be it. I'd rather do what I believe is right, than do what appears right simply to avoid criticism."
3139,"Wow, cool!"
3140,That's exactly what I thought. Love Half-Life.
3141,Nuances are important :)
3142,26 ft diameter tunnel running 2 miles under D.C.
3143,Really don't want to get in politics. I just want to help invent and develop technologies that improve lives. Feels so bizarre.
3144,"Yes, for now, but this should be addressed on all fronts: judicial, legislative and executive."
3145,"In addition, I again raised climate. I believe this is doing good, so will remain on council & keep at it. Doing otherwise would be wrong."
3146,"At my request, the agenda for yesterday's White House meeting went from not mentioning the travel ban to having it be first and foremost"
3147,First I've heard of this meeting. Will find out why.
3148,maybe
3149,Video of MIT's entrant into the SpaceX Hyperloop competition. Air has been removed from the  Hyperloop tube to almost vacuum conditions.  …
3150,Minecraft
3151,"Yes. Green cards & dual citizens already ok. Work & spousal visas not yet, but hopefully soon. This is separate from judicial action."
3152,There has already been and there will be progress on this matter
3153,Regarding the meeting at the White House:
3154,yes
3155,Headline & article is misleading. I said it won't be retracted (ie withdrawn by Pres). It may be revoked by judicial or legislative means.
3156,"Yes, I believe that is critical to ensure a good future for humanity"
3157,Top AI researchers agree on principles for developing benefical AI  
3158,"I agree with creating great jobs, restoring US strength as a great manufacturer of products and anything that makes the future exciting"
3159,"Yeah, sorry about that :)"
3160,"Yes, the order is still bad, but it is always important to read the source material"
3161,Reading the source material is better than reading other people's opinions about the source material  …
3162,Strategic & Policy Forum
3163,"Exactly. There is no possibility of retraction, but there is possibility of modification. It's just a non-zero possibility. Don't know more."
3164,Please read immigration order. Lmk specific amendments. Will seek advisory council consensus & present to President.  …
3165,It is not
3166,"Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right,not wrong & don't deserve to be rejected."
3167,The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country’s challenges
3168,"This is silly. If adding lanes actually did make it worse, that would imply removing lanes makes it better. Obv not true."
3169,And we start digging the tunnel tonight  …
3170,Hyperloop pod race happening this weekend at SpaceX HQ (near LAX). We built a ~mile long vacuum tube on our campus big enough to fit people.
3171,"Yeah, am hearing this from a lot of people & it's getting me down. I'm just trying to make a positive contribution & hope good comes of it."
3172,"Earthquakes tend to have the biggest effect on the surface, like waves on water. That's why LA can have a (lame, but getting better) subway."
3173,"Starting across from my desk at SpaceX. Crenshaw and the 105 Freeway, which is 5 mins from LAX"
3174,Yup
3175,Maybe next month
3176,Exciting progress on the tunnel front. Plan to start digging in a month or so.
3177,Rex Tillerson supports a carbon tax. This is what is really needed to move the needle.  …
3178,I'm just saying that we should see what happens first. The actions may be surprising.
3179,No they don't
3180,Was wondering what those were
3181,Sigh
3182,That may be a difficult award to decline
3183,"Tillerson also said that “the risk of climate change does exist” and he believed “action should be taken"""
3184,"... on how to address threats of climate change. They do require a global response."""

3186,"Ok, fine. Soldier 76. My dark secret is out ..."
3187,I share The Economist's opinion that he should be given the benefit of the doubt unless his actions prove otherwise
3188,"Rex is an exceptionally competent executive, understands geopolitics and knows how to win for his team. His team is now the USA."
3189,"This may sound surprising coming from me, but I agree with The Economist. Rex Tillerson has the potential to be an excellent Sec of State."
3190,There will be a software update this weekend that improves self-calibration ability
3191,"3 months maybe, 6 months definitely"
3192,"Yes, safety should improve significantly due to autonomy features, even if regs disallow no driver present"

3195,For now
3196,"The 100D price takes into account exchange rate shifts, whereas other vehicle prices haven't yet been adjusted"
3197,Yes. Block 5 is the final upgrade of the Falcon architecture. Significantly improves performance & ease of reusability. Flies end of year.
3198,"If we applied resources to doing super complex retrofits, our pace of innovation would drop dramatically"
3199,Tesla will never stop innovating. People are buying the wrong car if they expect this. There will be major revs every 12 to 18 months.
3200,Yes
3201,"Unfortunately, that would require stripping down the entire car and replacing 300+ parts. Wish there was an easy way."
3202,Giant X made of Model X's by Tesla owners in China!  …
3203,Expendable. Future flights will go on Falcon Heavy or the upgraded Falcon 9.

3231,"Good point. 2.34 would be a production Tesla. Stripped down, maybe as low as 2.1."
3232,It will
3233,Promising early results from the Ludricrous Easter egg. Looks like 0 to 60 mph in 2.34 sec (Motor Trend spec) might be achievable...
3234,"If the results look good from the latest point release, then we are days away from a release to all HW1 and to all HW2 early next week"

3255,Brain is full right now and that's a hard one
3256,"There are some installed already, but full rollout really needs Supercharger V3 and Powerpack V2, plus SolarCity. Pieces now in place."
3257,"If you don't like the P100DL, you can give it back"
3258,Good idea
3259,Yes
3260,"Should complete in 2017. One is def planned for Swift Current, near my cousin's wheat farm where I had my 18th bday."

3266,"No major precipitating event, but people in general were going a bit too fast on winding roads"
3267,"Some years away, but yes"
3268,"Will be restored soon where there is a lead vehicle, ie you are being overtaken a lot due to true traffic speed being higher than the sign"
3269,Night is easy. Twilight is hardest.
3270,That is actually rolling out to all Model X's right now
3271,Yes
3272,"8.1, which hopefully goes out next week."

3338,We will probably offer that as an option
3339,exactly
3340,Loving this thread :)
3341,Primarily aluminium with hot-stamped boron steel reinforcements. B pillar has a glass overlay.
3342,Excellent safety in rollover (5 star+). That was what took so long to develop.
3343,"In addition, we reinforced the surrounding body structure for improved safety (was already 5 star in all categories)."

3392,thanks!
3393,Umm...Autobahn?
3394,obviously wrong
3395,@heiseonline Not actually based on science. Objective data shows Autopilot is safer than manually driven cars.
3396,"@FortuneMagazine Utter nonsense. Empirical evidence is what matters, not random speculation."
3397,Sounds like a great move!
3398,Good for Germany!  …
3399,That's why we need to accelerate solar power

3403,impact velocity and center of mass of colliding object make a big difference
3404,Probably not then either
3405,Would also like to correct expectations that Tesla/SolarCity will need to raise equity or corp debt in Q4. Won't be necessary for either.
3406,"Tesla product unveiling on the 17th (unexpected by most), followed by Tesla/SolarCity on the 28th"
3407,I agree. Speed of light is a point in favor of the sim.
3408,"US automotive deaths rose 10% to 17,775 in first half of 2016, approx 1 every 88 million miles  …"
3409,Cumulative Tesla Autopilot miles now at 222 million
3410,lot of circumstantial evidence for that hypothesis
3411,Thus I deserve to be top of the target list? Maybe there's a dude who really digs the color gold who is slightly more deserving…
3412,"Yeah, and several others at various times. My twitter list is trimmed down to almost all news/comedy these days."
3413,"When we upgrade the core Linux OS to 4.4, which is probably December"
3414,"Sabotage of the rocket is unlikely, but this article has some great theories :)  …"
3415,"True, it is a no-win situation"

3417,Exactly. Those are the best ones.
3418,Going out this week for X and outside North America
3419,"Wow, this tweet is like a Rorschach test"
3420,"No irony or uhh ""shade"" meant here. T's character is excellent and well-played. Worth seeing."

3424,Will do a Reddit AMA on Mars in the next week or two
3425,"Corrective action taken. Seems to be limited to a small number of cases, but thanks for letting me know. "
3426,Am tracking this down ... Super important to be fair. There are zero discounts even for family and friends.
3427,Something messed up here. Tesla policy is equal pricing for all. No discounts ever unless a car is a floor model or was damaged.

3452,"also, the Tesla is poison free!"
3453,all cars
3454,can't always detect babies and pets
3455,Can be turned on or off. V8.1 will allow always-on min and max temps to be set.
3456,Tesla keeps temp below 40C/105F by automatically venting cabin & turning on AC when needed. Can do this for up to a year on a full charge.
3457,My favorite new feature is the always-on max temp control for keeping kids and pets safe from overheating.
3458,This is a major overhaul on almost every level compared to V7.
3459,"V8.0 starts downloading tonight. Release will be gradual to make sure there aren't small regressions. Many car configs, many environments."
3460,"Yeah, definitely one of my favorite names"

3485,We have not ruled that out.
3486,"nope, it wasn't me"
3487,Particularly trying to understand the quieter bang sound a few seconds before the fireball goes off. May come from rocket or something else.
3488,"Support & advice from @NASA, @FAA, @AFPAA & others much appreciated. Please email any recordings of the event to report@spacex.com."
3489,Important to note that this happened during a routine filling operation. Engines were not on and there was no apparent heat source.
3490,Still working on the Falcon fireball investigation. Turning out to be the most difficult and complex failure we have ever had in 14 years.
3491,It's been a little crazy lately
3492,"yes. This seems instant from a human perspective, but it really a fast fire, not an explosion. Dragon would have been fine."
3493,Finishing Autopilot blog postponed to  end of weekend
3494,Loss of Falcon vehicle today during propellant fill operation. Originated around upper stage oxygen tank. Cause still unknown. More soon.
3495,"Not allowed, according to HK regulations. Happy to do it if regs change."
3496,We need to do one more minor rev on 8.0 and then will go to wide release in a few weeks

3512,Would like to thank @nvidia and Jensen for donating the first DGX-1 AI supercomputer to @OpenAI in support of democratizing AI technology
3513,"Yeah. Movie still enjoyable due to some great characters, but plot & editing could've been better. Really needed more Joker+Harley."
3514,Sure feels weird to find myself defending the robots
3515,Never. There is no product rationale for doing so.
3516,probably makes sense to build off the pickup truck chassis
3517,Model Y (compact SUV) off Model 3 chassis. Tesla Bus/Minibus/Spacebus off Model X.
3518,good point

3526,Will be live streaming the Gigafactory launch party tonight. Check    this eve.
3527,The libertarian argument for a carbon tax  …
3528,"Good summary of yesterday's Gigafactory Q&A with JB, Yamada-San and me  …"
3529,Should mention that Gigafactory will be fully powered by clean energy when complete & include battery recycling
3530,happy birthday!
3531,Insurance premiums expected to decline by 80% due to driverless cars  …
3532,Letter from basically every scientific org in the United States to Congress about climate change  
3533,Via @NPR: Sun-Powered Airplane Completes Historic Trip Around The World  
3534,Maybe as a future optimization. Would only matter if it was extremely big.
3535,as long as I'm alive
3536,  …
3537,Looking forward to the Gigafactory opening party on Friday next week. The scale blows me away every time I see it.
3538,Autopilot prevents serious injury or death of a pedestrian in NY (owner anecdote confirmed by vehicle logs)
3539,"Jerome is driving Tesla Semi & doing a great job with his team. At Daimler, he led their most successful semi truck program ever."
3540,It's inspired by some of the California Custom VW combi design art
3541,Great game. Whole Fallout series is amazing.
3542,Both should have been done under the same corporate umbrella from the beginning
3543,"Tesla Master Plan, Part Deux  …"
3544,now 2Pac
3545,California time
3546,Post should go live on Tesla website around 5pm
3547,yup
3548,busted
3549,Except for the tweet about large amounts of crack (actually just small amounts)
3550,Not easy to convey irony in a tweet
3551,Lana
3552,Finishing off the plan while listening to the soundtrack from Gatsby. Seems appropriate...
3553,"Will be working at Tesla on Autopilot & Model 3 today, then aiming to pull an all-nighter and complete the master product plan"
3554,I am!
3555,Returning from Cape Canaveral to California...
3556,"Really tempting to redesign upper stage for return too (Falcon Heavy has enough power), but prob best to stay focused on the Mars rocket"
3557,Can't wait to see all three cores of Falcon Heavy come back for landings! First two will be almost simultaneous.  …
3558,Landing
3559,free Babel fish provided
3560,Bit of a distraction yesterday. Working on plan today.
3561,Out on LZ-1. We just completed the post-landing inspection and all systems look good. Ready to fly again.
3562,Falcon on LZ-1 at Cape Canaveral
3563,"Thanks. Exactly. Some in the press think they're so much smarter than Tesla owners that ""they know better"". Makes no sense."
3564,"V8 will be our biggest release since v1, so taking longer to refine. Awesome on every level. Meeting w design team every day."
3565,"Tesla customers are v smart & don't want media speaking on their behalf abt Autopilot. Recent poll: 0.0% want it disabled -- not 0.1%, 0.0%."
3566,"It can at moderate range, but our ultrasonics are very good at human (or anything >= water density) detection"
3567,Improved fan speed algorithm coming soon. Doesn't need to be so loud.
3568,Great rebuttal by a Tesla owner to those calling for Autopilot to be disabled. Was written with zero input from us.  …
3569,That is a very good point!
3570,Have to focus on tonight's @SpaceX launch. Will post Tesla (master) product plan afterwards.
3571,"Btw, want to thank both Bosch and MobilEye for their help and support in making Autopilot better. Please direct all criticism at Tesla."
3572,"Promising call today with @BoschGlobal, maker of our radar sensor. Looks like significant improvements possible via OTA software update."
3573,much appreciated
3574,Usually true. We need more sane and reasonable people making their voice heard.
3575,Sensible article on Autopilot by @the guardian  …
3576,On the other hand I do answer a toy phone like it's real
3577,large amounts of crack
3578,"6 hours normally, but a lot less these days"
3579,Sunday is the end of the week :)
3580,yes
3581,good up to ~160km/h
3582,Our radar is using a wavelength of 3.9mm. A good size for both decent resolution and rain penetration. Am hopeful...
3583,especially well
3584,Logs were downloaded for NHTSA and NTSB. Identical copies to all.
3585,"Good thing about radar is that, unlike lidar (which is visible wavelength), it can see through rain, snow, fog and dust"
3586,yes
3587,certainly moderate and maybe big advances w no incremental hardware
3588,effective stereo by comparing data at various points in time while moving
3589,elevation too
3590,only just gained access to physical vehicle
3591,AP process crash would show up in logs
3592,"Working on using existing Tesla radar by itself (decoupled from camera) w temporal smoothing to create a coarse point cloud, like lidar"
3593,"Maybe didn't realize he turned it off, but the car does issue a loud chime and a visual warning on the instrument cluster."
3594,exactly
3595,"Onboard vehicle logs show Autopilot was turned off in Pennsylvania crash. Moreover, crash would not have occurred if it was on."
3596,EU regulators find no safety concerns with Autopilot  …
3597,It's all fun & games until ...   …
3598,We don't mind taking the heat for customer safety. It is the right thing to do. From @RoadandTrack  …
3599,can't wait to see the costume
3600,@FredericLambert Only if I can play a monkey
3601,"Tesla finishes last in being salesy! Good. Also, I can't believe there is a real Pied Piper.  …"
3602,Something like that  …
3603,already taken care of
3604,Kinda. Creating a seamlessly integrated Tesla battery & solar power product that looks beautiful is the reason  …
3605,I like your tweets!
3606,"Tricky in 140 chars, but: 1B needed for min statistical sample size. More software mods and data may be needed beyond that."
3607,Blog on Autopilot by @PeterDiamandis   
3608,US is ~11 deaths per billion miles. WW is 17 deaths per billion. Autopilot already much better than either so far.
3609,Unless we get there and find it isn't enough. Just won't be before 1B.
3610,"It is extensively tested in the lab and in the Tesla test fleet. However, there is no substitute for real world experience."
3611,"With less than 1B miles, there simply isn't enough data. 1B is a necessary but not necessarily sufficient condition."
3612,"Thanks. Point of calling it ""beta"" was to emphasize to those who chose to use it that it wasn't perfect."
3613,exactly
3614,"that wasn't criticism, just clarification"
3615,why?
3616,thought I was posting Reuters. Copied the wrong link.
3617,Probably six months. Will include hundreds of refinements to handle rare corner cases in Autopilot.
3618,"you're right, no point"
3619,"Use of word ""beta"" is explicitly so that drivers don't get comfortable. It is not beta software in the standard sense."
3620,"Misunderstanding of what ""beta"" means to Tesla for Autopilot: any system w less than 1B miles of real world driving  …"
3621,Today is Nikola Tesla's birthday. I hope he likes what we've done in his name.
3622,"Working on Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, Part 2. Hoping to publish later this week."
3623,"Story was fed to LAT & many other media to counter IMF $5T/year fossil subsidy study. Hey, both have a 5!"
3624,seriously
3625,Love reddit. Gandel gets shredded & won't even answer top 3 upvoted questions. Some really funny comments about Koch  …
3626,"Model S had the lowest probability of injury of any car ever tested by NHTSA, which is why ...  …"
3627,thanks
3628,"true, good point"
3629,"No, you were misleading mostly on your own, but w many copycats. Jalopnik just lost it's sense of irony & didn't get my tweet."
3630,"cool, thanks :)"
3631,The Google term of self-driving would probably be more appropriate then.
3632,"In other words, the intended implication is that a driver must remain alert, just as a pilot must remain alert."
3633,"Tesla Tesla Autopilot is named after aircraft autopilot, as it is always expected that a pilot must stay alert."
3634,"All publicly known Tesla product developments are called out, incl vehicles and batteries. Would be odd *not* to include."
3635,Tesla response to the misleading Fortune articles about Autopilot  
3636,Sponsored articles …  …
3637,Because of course I hate flamingos...(maybe try eating fewer flamingo eggs in your salad)  …
3638,Exactly! I love Twitter.
3639,Wrong to exclude non-occupant deaths. Autopilot would have prevented this cyclist from being killed  …
3640,"If you care about auto deaths as material to stock prices, why no articles about 1M+/year deaths from other auto companies?"
3641,"Yes, it was material to you -- BS article increased your advertising revenue. Just wasn't material to TSLA, as shown by market."
3642,Radar tunes out what looks like an overhead road sign to avoid false braking events
3643,Our condolences for the tragic loss  …
3644,Shakespeare. Then love-devouring death do what he dare
3645,aspirationally

3647,Thoughtful analysis of the Tesla/SolarCity merger by @tsrandall  …
3648,Thanks for the kind bday wishes!

3651,@mashable We haven't signed anything for a factory in China
3652,"Deluded, deranged, etc. Journalistic thesaurus sure got a lot of use last week ...  …"
3653,"Article is misleading to readers. No one is ""taking home"" anything. In a stock for stock transaction, nothing comes off the table."
3654,Of course. Our love will never die.
3655,This is going to be great  …
3656,Drive units and battery are sealed
3657,"If curious abt TSWLM car, am still planning to do a sports sub car that can drive on roads. Just a side project. Limited market potential :)"
3658,"We *def* don't recommended this, but Model S floats well enough to turn it into a boat for short periods of time. Thrust via wheel rotation."
3659,Tesla owner drives through a flooded tunnel & out the other side  …
3660,"As mentioned at the beginning of the year, I'm expecting ~70% success rate on landings for the year. 2016 is the year of experimentation."
3661,Looks like early liquid oxygen depletion caused engine shutdown just above the deck
3662,"Turns out the landing was not as fast we thought, but still hard enough to destroy the primary airframe and accordion the engines"
3663,Thanks Tyler
3664,Landing video will be posted when we gain access to cameras on the droneship later today. Maybe hardest impact to date. Droneship still ok.
3665,Upgrades underway to enable rocket to compensate for a thrust shortfall on one of the three landing engines. Probably get there end of year.
3666,Quite rapid... Yes
3667,RUD = Rapid Unscheduled Disassembly :)
3668,Looks like thrust was low on 1 of 3 landing engines. High g landings v sensitive to all engines operating at max.
3669,"Ascent phase & satellites look good, but booster rocket had a RUD on droneship"
3670,Highly recommend anything by Sean Carroll  …
3671,"Am concerned that advanced life may be inherently unstable. Arguably, any civ capable of extinguishing itself eventually will."
3672,"Life you can talk to is another matter, of course. Many, many orders of magnitude less likely."
3673,No way. Look at chemotrophs and extremophiles. Primitive life is bloody everywhere. Highly under the ice on Europa imo.
3674,Hence the urgency of making life as we know it multiplanetary as soon as possible
3675,"That, speed of light constraint and quantum mechanics"
3676,"And, no, I'm not an alien...but I used to be one"
3677,Latest science predicts > trillion alien civilizations. Either they don't last long or there are a *lot* of aliens  …
3678,"Yeah, that matches what we've found so far. More likely unhinged than nefarious."
3679,Would seem to indicate that one or more people sought to create the false impression of a safety issue where none existed. Q is why?
3680,"Of greater concern: 37 of 40 suspension complaints to NHTSA were fraudulent, i.e. false location or vehicle identification numbers were used"
3681,NHTSA confirmed today that they found no safety concern with the Model S suspension and have no further need for data from us on this matter
3682,That is correct. It was about innovation.
3683,Nice comment about the Model S by CvK on @TopGear_BBCA  …
3684,no
3685,Something about a flying metal suit...  …
3686,yes
3687,S and X cells are also Panasonic
3688,Would like to clarify that Tesla is working exclusively with Panasonic for Model 3 cells. News articles claiming otherwise are incorrect.
3689,Fourth rocket arrives in the hangar. Aiming for first reflight in Sept/Oct.
3690,"PC, of course"
3691,Highly recommend @PlayOverwatch by the good people of @Blizzard_Ent if you like ultrafast team FPS action  …
3692,Trippy  …
3693,@Recode I love Douglas Adams! My favorite spaceship ever is in HHGTTG.
3694,Exactly  …
3695,Good article from @themotleyfool explaining how little incentives have actually contributed to Tesla funding  …
3696,how did you know?
3697,Creating a neural lace is the thing that really matters for humanity to achieve symbiosis with machines
3698,exactly
3699,It is simulations all the way down

3707,Good summary of Tesla annual meeting by @katiefehren  …
3708,Sorry to hear that. Will take care of this & investigate to see if issues you encountered are systemic.
3709,So it was good for you too ...  …
3710,Fast replay of today's rocket landing on SpaceX droneship OCISLY  
3711,"Very similar. The crush core in the Falcon legs is reusable after soft landings, but needs to be replaced after hard."
3712,Crush core is aluminum honeycomb for energy absorption in the telescoping actuator. Easy to replace (if Falcon makes it back to port).
3713,"Rocket landing speed was close to design max & used up contingency crush core, hence back & forth motion. Prob ok, but some risk of tipping."
3714,"Satellite deployed to 91,000 km apogee. All looks good."
3715,3 mins to launch  …
3716,"There was a tiny glitch in the motion of an upper stage engine actuator. Probably not a flight risk, but still worth investigating."
3717,Really fun Model X review by @MotorTrend. Best part is X racing while towing a fuel sports car  …
3718,"Flight 24 is def capable of flying again, but it makes sense to apply ground delta qual to rocket w toughest entry conditions."
3719,Great image of ancient Mars  …
3720,"No prob. We care about doing what's fair & just. Don't always get it right, but intent is always there & we make amends when wrong"
3721,"Per the letter, Tesla paid $55/hr for *additional* services, so no."
3722,"Yes, but it is false of Merc News to say that Tesla took advantage of low cost labor. We paid $55/hr. That is unequivocal."
3723,"We still need to make sure that the injured person is taken care of, but less & less of the Merc story appears to be true"
3724,Merc News story about Tesla using $5/hr labor seems to be missing a digit. Tesla actually paid $55/hr.
3725,"Totally agree. Am told this will be fixed by Thurs, maybe Fri."
3726,Full height of Falcon 9 boost stage on legs is ~165 ft
3727,"Falcon Heavy side boosters can use most of the same airframe as Falcon 9, but center core needs to be buffed up a lot for transfer loads."
3728,Response to a Mercury News article about an injury on our premises  …
3729,Only heard about this today. Sounds like the wrong thing happened on many levels. Will investigate and make it right.
3730,"Better. Not there yet, but a solution is likely."
3731,yes
3732,yup
3733,"Most recent rocket took max damage, due to v high entry velocity. Will be our life leader for ground tests to confirm others are good."
3734,Three's company
3735,will do another AMA just before reflight of the rocket in a few months
3736,Dog snuggle thread on reddit. Comments get really good.  …
3737,Excited to announce Tesla's entry into automotive racing!  …
3738,también te amo
3739,It's probably the Ambien
3740,Definitely  …
3741,Ok  …
3742,Full credit to the team that's doing this. All happening without any help from me.  …
3743,@vicentes @TeslaMotors @Tim_Stevens @CNET coming soon
3744,@tzepr Certainly agree that it is first and foremost a triumph for humanity. The cheering is in good spirit.
3745,@LifeOfRockstar I think so
3746,@lukealization Max is just 3X Merlin thrust and min is ~40% of 1 Merlin. Two outer engines shut off before the center does.
3747,I love you too!  …
3748,"Launch trajectory of Japanese commercial satellite JCSat-14, enroute to 36,000 km above Earth "
3749,@hansmikael @TeslaMotors Thank goodness all are ok
3750,"Yeah, this was a three engine landing burn, so triple deceleration of last flight. That's important to minimize gravity losses."
3751,May need to increase size of rocket storage hangar
3752,Woohoo!!  …
3753,"Rocket reentry is a lot faster and hotter than last time, so odds of making it are maybe even, but we should learn a lot either way"
3754,"Tesla is increasing the production ramp as fast as possible, but I'd recommend ordering a Model 3 soon if you want 2018 delivery"
3755,@samsamlee777 yes
3756,Filtering particulates from air makes a significant & measurable diff to health. Wd like to credit Larry Page with turning me on to this.

3761,@scottymeuk @DericLew @SpaceflightIns @phillipcjackson exactly
3762,"@_andyoneal sides def, center maybe"
3763,@CyberdineX naturally
3764,Falcon Heavy thrust will be 5.1M lbf at liftoff --  twice any rocket currently flying. It's a beast...
3765,F9 thrust at liftoff will be raised to 1.71M lbf later this year. It is capable of 1.9M lbf in flight.
3766,"@elonmusk F9 LEO payload on capabilities page (correct figure on main page) should be 22,800 kg"
3767,"@lukealization No cross feed. It would help performance, but is not needed for these numbers."
3768,@lukealization No physical changes to the engine. This thrust increase is based on delta qual tests. It is just tougher than we thought.
3769,@elonmusk Max performance numbers are for expendable launches. Subtract 30% to 40% for reusable booster payload.
3770,"@mattyteare Basically current, but higher throttle setting. Good performance of recent launches allows us to reduce 3 sigma reserve margin."
3771,Just posted latest max payload capabilities of Falcon 9 and Heavy  …
3772,@dannysparker yes
3773,@phillipcjackson turns out it doesn't need securing
3774,@Mini_Elon yes
3775,"@vicentes @gdoehne yes, several times"
3776,@jbdeck for sure :)
3777,@Tweetermeyer things like this should be purged shortly
3778,@RokBottomGamers 100+ for almost everything 10+ for heat shields and a few other items.
3779,@VivekMGeorge Zuck doesn't (yet) have a deep tech understanding of AI. I spend hours every week being educated by world's best researchers.
3780,"@gdoehne JCSat is pushing the envelope as a very hot and fast mission, so will land on the droneship. Next land landing in a few months."
3781,@MrBoylan System scan detected only 0.2% of orders with same email and physical address. Those have been purged.
3782,@vigneshraju of course
3783,@maya_kazan Temporary spike in some areas due to X 3rd row seat recall. Should be sorted by June.
3784,"@MrBoylan Duplicates will be cancelled. Max of 2 will be delivered to any one person. Only ~5% of orders are 2, so speculation unlikely."
3785,@erothenberg Simple answer is that there just aren't many used Teslas available. Demand >> supply.
3786,@erothenberg checking into it ...
3787,@romn8tr will definitely do so
3788,"@abraham_cavazos some places are trickier than others, but yes. That's the value of having a PICA-3 heat shield with propulsive landing."
3789,"@Cardoso It could land on Venus no problem, but would last maybe a few hours. Tough local environment."
3790,But wouldn't recommend transporting astronauts beyond Earth-moon region. Wouldn't be fun for longer journeys. Internal volume ~size of SUV.
3791,Dragon 2 is designed to be able to land anywhere in the solar system. Red Dragon Mars mission is the first test flight.
3792,"@KristianNairn A 3 should be workable, but an S or particularly an X would be better"
3793,@scottmcnealy That article was incredibly misleading and you should know it. Wager right now that Sun has received far more than Tesla?
3794,Looks like Model X resale value is holding up well :)  …
3795,"@dannysparker Aiming for relaunch in 3 to 4 months, pending detailed examination and 10X refiring of a returned booster"
3796,@RealDarthBL We have amplified pre-delivery inspection to provide a stronger second layer of QA. Several parts being replaced as a result.

3858,@B_Rans yes. Will easily fit two child seats. Three if you buy slim seats.
3859,@gerardomarina Some tweaking underway
3860,@HBL_Cosmin Wait until you see the real steering controls and system for the 3. It feels like a spaceship.
3861,@MICHAELSD01 @TechGrlTweeter Won't happen. Reason initial cars are delivered close to factory is to have rapid turnaround on early issues.
3862,@scottkelley99 Edge and contour refinement are ongoing. Even .1mm matters.
3863,@_amwolo_ They can. Will be great for road trips and camping
3864,@BValvsRacing It will make sense after part 2 of the Model 3 unveil
3865,"A Model 3 order gives you priority in your geography, so, even tho total count is high, ordering early will make a big difference locally."
3866,"In general, product comments, suggestions and criticisms are always welcome"
3867,@RyanCasburn We always try to maximize customer happiness even if that means a revenue shortfall in a quarter. Loyalty begets loyalty.
3868,@SnoozeThroughF1 There will be an optional tow hitch.
3869,@RGspan Our production ramp plan should enable large numbers of non X/S customers to receive the credit.
3870,@jeffrey @neutyp Matte black was surprisingly popular. Probably makes sense to bring it to production.
3871,"@WaltNew cool, thanks!"
3872,"@mindthreat @RyanHummer Yes, if the trend continues, before"
3873,276k Model 3 orders by end of Sat
3874,Model 3 design sketches

3876,@Model3Owners They will. We spent a lot of time on those.
3877,"@vicentes Roadster, S and X customers are the ones who got us here and are paying for 3. They deserve a lot of credit."
3878,"@Aakashhh_ we will send something to everyone who ordered, but an extra gift for those who stood in some crazy long lines"
3879,"@raytech247 yes, within a region. Can't deliver to all regions simultaneously. Too much complexity."
3880,@squallcraft and a few other things
3881,"Token of appreciation for those who lined up coming via mail. Thought maybe 20-30 people per store would line up, not 800. Gifts on order."
3882,@34thrain Maybe 1/4 to 1/2 of what happened. No one at Tesla thought it would be this high before part 2 of the unveil.
3883,"Will give an update tonight for the 3 day total, then last one on Wed for the full week. All efforts focused on accelerating the ramp."
3884,253k as of 7am this morning

3934,@chrisdbond checking ...
3935,@lorengrush exactly :)
3936,Pushing launch to Friday due to extreme high altitude wind shear. Hits like a sledgehammer when going up supersonic
3937,@PernilleT Only heard about it today. Doesn't sound like they are in the right though in their dealings with our subcontractor.
3938,@SpaceX Launch aborted on low thrust alarm. Rising oxygen temps due to hold for boat and helium bubble triggered alarm.
3939,@SpaceX AF has placed launch on hold due to a boat entering the edge of the keep out zone. Scrambling helo to get them to move.
3940,"@TLKFremont Great leg room for 3rd row, rear visibility better, easy storage of long cargo."
3941,"@derekslager @skiesforme yes, it actually performed better than other colors on stain tests. Best not to have vented seats w kids though."
3942,"@skiesforme Can't emphasize enough that white is the best interior. Also, pick 6 seats unless you really need 7."
3943,"@skiesforme @TeslaMotors That said, the white interior is the best. Highly recommend."
3944,@skiesforme Heavy use of the white causes splitting. Adding backing material to strengthen. Will be upgraded at no cost.
3945,Worth reposting the Wait But Why piece on AI. We are at the beginning of exponential growth in digital intelligence.  …

3948,"There is no way it is only 0.5%, given the staggeringly massive number of fossil subsidies that exist in every country, or as high as 50%."
3949,"Global economy of $100T is overwhelmingly fossil fuel based, so IMF estimate of $5T or 5% for carbon subsidy is def right order of magnitude"
3950,Just wanted to thank Stu G for   . Know it meant a lot to you. Will take good care.

3959,@BasseyE @tegmark yes
3960,Interesting to think of physics as a set of compression algorithms for the universe. That's basically what formulas are.
3961,"@chriskreidler @engadget yes, this was done jointly with Tesla and Radio Flyer"
3962,This baby Model S really is quite fun  …
3963,More details on Model 3 unveil in coming weeks. That's it for now.
3964,@MysteryGuitarM yes
3965,No signature series for Model 3. Same reservation amount for all.
3966,@garethseneque global
3967,Model 3 reservations ($1000 down) will be accepted in Tesla stores on March 31 and online April 1
3968,@ErikRoesegg good point
3969,Should mention that Tesla Motors itself had nothing to do with the short movie. This was completely independent.
3970,Love this Tesla video made by  …
3971,My job moonlighting as a police officer in Brazil is no longer secret  …
3972,Must be a slow news day if denying service to a super rude customer gets this much attention
3973,@TheEconomist Interesting name
3974,@Benzinga I didn't take anyone's car and never would. Car was actually allocated to engineering test (not by me) and inadvertently sold.
3975,"My best guess for 2016: ~70% landing success rate (so still a few more RUDs to go), then hopefully improving to ~90% in 2017"
3976,@JeffBezos @SpaceX Thanks Jeff
3977,"Falcon lands on droneship, but the lockout collet doesn't latch on one the four legs, causing it…   "
3978,"@stunt_penguin @LayOn_OverWhale Stage 1 would reach low Earth orbit if not hefting a second stage, but payload would be greatly reduced."
3979,"@JimmyVosika Actually, didn't get environmental approval in time, but it was also good practice for missions where a ship is needed."
3980,"If speed at stage separation > ~6000 km/hr. With a ship, no need to zero out lateral velocity, so can stage at up to ~9000 km/h."
3981,Ship landings are not needed for flexibility or to save fuel costs. Just not physically possible to return to launch site
3982,"As mentioned before, ship landings are needed for high velocity missions. Altitude & distance don't mean much for orbit. All about speed."
3983,@mbhnyc steel collet
3984,"Well, at least the pieces were bigger this time! Won't be last RUD, but am optimistic about upcoming ship landing. "
3985,@Uncle_Gus probably
3986,"However, that was not what prevented it being good. Touchdown speed was ok, but a leg lockout didn't latch, so it tipped over after landing."
3987,"Definitely harder to land on a ship. Similar to an aircraft carrier vs land: much smaller target area, that's also translating & rotating."
3988,Maybe some debris ingestion. Engine data looks ok. Will borescope tonight. This is one of the outer engines.
3989,"Conducted hold-down firing of returned Falcon rocket. Data looks good overall, but engine 9 showed thrust fluctuations."
3990,Next launch is a @NASA science mission from VAFB California on Sunday.  …
3991,Aiming to launch this weekend and (hopefully) land on our droneship. Ship landings needed for high velocity missions  …
3992,Sad to hear that David Bowie died. He was amazing.
3993,"In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land & not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY"
3994,"Tap your phone or key and your car will open the garage door, exit, close the door and come to you. Will do same in reverse for unsummon."

4004,"11 satellites deployed to target orbit and Falcon has landed back at Cape Canaveral. Headed to LZ-1. Welcome back, baby!"
4005,Background on the launch  …
4006,Launch & landing can be seen on the    webcast or in person from Cape Canaveral public causeway at 8:33pm local tmrw
4007,Just reviewed mission params w SpaceX team. Monte Carlo runs show tmrw night has a 10% higher chance of a good landing. Punting 24 hrs.
4008,Currently looking good for a Sunday night (~8pm local) attempted orbital launch and rocket landing at Cape Canaveral
4009,Meant to reply to this article:  …
4010,This article does not appreciate that Tesla is in California despite taxes net of rebates being higher. Incentives only a partial offset.
4011,"Static fire test looks good. Pending data review, will aim to launch Sunday."
4012,Rounding up to 1 sec for a bit of timing margin. Updating flight computer command sequence …
4013,Aborted on ignition timing due to slow ground side valve. Adjusting ignition sequence by 0.6 secs for next attempt.
4014,About 2 mins from static fire
4015,@elonmusk holding for issue resolution
4016,Abort triggered by flight computer on upper stage throttle valve. Adjusting thresholds and restarting count at T-10 mins.
4017,5 mins from static fire test
4018,"@lukealization yes, from 70F to 20 F"
4019,@craigcocca It worked in Texas
4020,@PaigeANjax -340 F in this case. Deep cryo increases density and amplifies rocket performance. First time anyone has gone this low for O2.
4021,Falcon 9 is vertical on the launch pad at Cape Canaveral. Working towards static fire. Deep cryo liquid oxygen presenting some challenges.
4022,@mashabletech @mashable Not really my letter (no authorship contribution). Just agreed to add my name when they asked.
4023,Vance article on self-driving cars was inaccurate  
4024,Announcing formation of @open_ai …   …

4032,"@ID_AA_Carmack Yep, good points. I hope you get back into space some day!"
4033,But credit for 1st reusable suborbital rocket goes to X-15   … And Burt Rutan for commercial   …
4034,Jeff maybe unaware SpaceX suborbital VTOL flight began 2013. Orbital water landing 2014. Orbital land landing next.  …
4035,"@JeffBezos Not quite ""rarest"". SpaceX Grasshopper rocket did 6 suborbital flights 3 years ago & is still around. "
4036,@TobiasVdb The F9 booster can reach low orbit as a single stage if not carrying the upper stage and a heavy satellite.
4037,"Getting to space needs ~Mach 3, but GTO orbit requires ~Mach 30. The energy needed is the square, i.e. 9 units for space and 900 for orbit."
4038,"It is, however, important to clear up the difference between ""space"" and ""orbit"", as described well by   "
4039,Congrats to Jeff Bezos and the BO team for achieving VTOL on their booster
4040,"@levie Sounds perfect, you had me at ""enterprise""."
4041,@StartupLJackson Yeah and hell yeah
4042,@atduarte From anywhere
4043,Should mention that I will be interviewing people personally and Autopilot reports directly to me. This is a super high priority.

4054,I should clarify that    is an independent website. We don't have any control over the content.
4055,Cool!  …
4056,"@anakinSGE Hopefully, mid to late next year. We are being more cautious abt expanding countries to ensure a great user experience each time."
4057,"@GangsOfGtown Given high local demand, a Gigafactory in India would probably make sense in the long term."
4058,"@abrax4s Yes, establishing charging and service infrastructure in Mexico now. Official launch in next several months."
4059,@javashri Auto import duties are prohibitively high. Hoping for a special category for EVs. Most of our discussion was about batteries.
4060,@roneijlander We just finished building a huge expansion in Tilburg!
4061,"These are all things I've said before and are naturally needed to improve in-market affordability, so no real news here."
4062,Model 3 is due in ~2 yrs. A China factory for local demand cd be as soon as a year after. A factory in Europe wd happen for same reason.
4063,My comments in China weren't transcribed correctly. Tesla will keep making cars & batteries in CA & NV as far into future as I can imagine.
4064,"@JessicaTetreau important to set AC to not recirc (air exits thru rear) and use the snap in shade, which Tesla service can provide"
4065,@shanenickerson Amount of change needed is enormous - like a spinal cord transplant. Would cost less and work better with a new car.
4066,"Autopilot 1.01 coming soon: curve speed adaption, controller smoothness, better lane holding on poor roads, improved fleet learning!"

4182,"@TeslaP85D That is true. If someone says they are thinking about having kids, I always encourage them to do so."
4183,It is total BS & hurtful to claim that I told a guy to miss his child's birth just to attend a company meeting. I would never do that.
4184,"Of 22 Quotes from   , 2 need correcting: 1. I strongly support pregnancy leave 2. I've never called myself a samurai"
4185,@voxdotcom I have never written or said this. Ashlee's book was not independently fact-checked. Should be taken w a grain of salt.

4201,@andrewket @TeslaRoadTrip Wow!
4202,"While the rocket does look rather tall & tippy, a stable landing is no problem with proper throttle response  …"
4203,Cause of hard rocket landing confirmed as due to slower than expected throttle valve response. Next attempt in 2 months.
4204,@Aero4Real I only invest in companies I help found or to help a friend or a cause (no return expected for latter two)
4205,Droneship is fine. No hull breach and repairs are minor. Impact overpressure is closer to a fast fire than an explosion.
4206,"High resolution, color corrected, slow motion rocket landing video  "
4207,"If this works, I'm treating myself to a volcano lair. It's time."
4208,"Ok, looks like we got some killer footage from the chase plane. Big ocean, small ship. Posting vid shortly "
4209,"Looks like Falcon landed fine, but excess lateral velocity caused it to tip over post landing "
4210,"Ascent successful. Dragon enroute to Space Station. Rocket landed on droneship, but too hard for survival."
4211,3 mins to liftoff
4212,"Launch window always tight when orbital synch needed. In this case, Space Station. For Earth-Sun gravity null point, moon was in the way."
4213,Launch postponed due to lightning from an approaching anvil cloud
4214,Odds of rocket landing successfully today are still less than 50%. The 80% figure by end of year is only bcs many launches ahead.
4215,Have asked SolarCity if we can do something philanthropic with the CA aqueducts to help the water crisis. Investigating…
4216,@benfeldman63 Thanks!
4217,"We debated this, but there really is $10k gas saved by most owners over 5 yrs (avg ownership period). Since it's true, we are sticking w it."

4230,"Right move is try both tunnels and flying cars. Otherwise, having 2D streets and 3D buildings means bad traffic forever."
4231,"Reasons I like tunnels: you still travel in 3D fast, but immune to weather, quiet and no risk cars fall on your head"
4232,"Flying car pros: travel in 3D fast. Cons: risk of car falling on head much greater, noisy, grounded in bad weather"

4245,"Neither I nor the company are selling shares. Even if we were, I wouldn't do this. It would be wrong. Our long term results are what matter."
4246,Some people seem to think I tweet to affect share price. This is false. A brief rise in $TSLA stock obviously does no good for Tesla or me.

4262,Tesla Model S rated by @ConsumerReports as best car in world for 2nd year in a row  …
4263,Landing on a stormy sea
4264,Rocket soft landed in the ocean within 10m of target & nicely vertical! High probability of good droneship landing in non-stormy weather.
4265,Primary mission on target. Spacecraft head towards the sun! All good there.
4266,@DanielLockyer We could actually do that...maybe we should
4267,Planning a significant upgrade of the droneship for future missions to handle literally anything. Maybe give it a Merlin for good measure :)

4275,"Prob good though. Will give us time to replace 1st stage video transmitter (not needed for launch, but nice to have)."
4276,Air Force tracking radar went down. Launch postponed to same time tomorrow.
4277,Rocket reentry will be much tougher this time around due to deep space mission. Almost 2X force and 4X heat. Plenty of hydraulic fluid tho.
4278,"Launching our 1st deep space mission today. Headed to Earth-Sun L1 gravity null point at 1M miles, 4X further than moon."

4283,Tesla dual motor cars are also all-wheel drive. Main goal of dual motor was actually insane traction on snow. Insane speed was a side effect
4284,Tesla P85D 0 to 60mph acceleration will improve by ~0.1 sec soon via over-the-air software update to inverter algorithm
4285,"Great DragTimes video of people experiencing P85D ""Insane Mode"" acceleration for the first time  …"
4286,Final one: anything launched by a railgun (if you could ever reach ~ Mach 27) would explode upon exiting the barrel in our dense atmosphere

4288,And pls don't ask me about space elevators  until someone at least builds a carbon nanotube structure longer than a footbridge
4289,"Reason is Newton's Third Law. In vacuum, there is nothing to ""push"" against. You must react against ejected mass."

4311,Am super proud of my crew for making huge strides towards reusability on this mission. You guys rock!
4312,"Upcoming flight already has 50% more hydraulic fluid, so should have plenty of margin for landing attempt next month."
4313,"Grid fins worked extremely well from hypersonic velocity to subsonic, but ran out of hydraulic fluid right before landing."
4314,Didn't get good landing/impact video. Pitch dark and foggy. Will piece it together from telemetry and ... actual pieces.
4315,Ship itself is fine. Some of the support equipment on the deck will need to be replaced...

4340,"@ID_AA_Carmack That works for Dragon, but hard to do for something long like Falcon"
4341,"The flight grid fins look like the ones on this test we did, but larger:  …"
4342,@ID_AA_Carmack No choice. Entry velocity too high for a precision landing with N2 thrusters alone. Must have aero surfaces for pitch trim.
4343,@John_Gardi Using legs as air brakes to drop terminal velocity in half requires slight redesign & more data. Maybe flight 21.
4344,"Grid fins are stowed on ascent and then deploy on reentry for ""x-wing"" style control. Each fin moves independently for pitch/yaw/roll."
4345,"Base is 300 ft by 100 ft, with wings that extend width to 170 ft. Will allow refuel & rocket flyback in future."

4730,@realbhuwan Don't forget the mystery announcement. Part 5 of the trilogy.
4731,There is a way for the Tesla Model S to be recharged throughout the country faster than you could fill a gas tank.
4732,@HowardReiter Totally agree. Tesla will circle back and do something cool for Roadsters next year.
4733,@mjasandoval Stay tuned
4734,"Just want to say thanks to customers & investors that took a chance on Tesla through the long, dark night. We wouldn't be here without you."
4735,@westcoastbill Thanks Bill!
4736,"Am a fan of Larry, Sergey & Google in general, but self-driving cars comments to Bloomberg were just off-the-cuff. No big announcement here"

4741,"Anyone interested in doing ultra hardcore vehicle engineering at Tesla, please apply!"
4742,Chris Porritt from Aston Martin just joined as head of vehicle engineering at Tesla   …

4752,@thebradholt we need a compelling video that convinces TX lawmakers to pass the direct sales law just approved by their committee.
4753,@Rocco_TheStreet Guaranteeing the world's best resale value in industry is unprecedented and backed up my other assets. Why isn't that good?
4754,"@ChrisCowan_  Chris is great. Took a long time for me to find someone w truly hardcore engineering skills, who fully understood the system."

4771,@realbhuwan @teslamotors Cool :)
